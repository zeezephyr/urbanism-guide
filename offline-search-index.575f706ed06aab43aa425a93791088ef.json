[{"body":"Who You Are Being informed about urbanist issues involves finding groups and sources of information that can help you find what to act on. Everyone cares about different aspects of urbanism be it housing, equity, public transit, bike lanes, safety, etc. Lean into this.\nBeing an urbanist does not require that you know and do everything. There are many of us. If we each pick and do what we’re most interested in then the overall goals of urbanism will be better for it. Doing urbanism is mostly volunteer and unpaid work so if you’re going to do it you may as well like either the work, the outcome, or both.\nWhat do urbanists do? Urbanists make their voice heard. It may sound simple or cheesy but this is what anti-urbanists do and it’s why our neighborhoods are put together so poorly and unfairly. We are going to change this.\nWe do this in a variety of ways that vary from low effort to high effort. Start where you want but we suggest starting with simple, low effort actions to dip your toes, familiarize yourself, and build from there. All of these efforts can and do have a high impact on how our cities and towns evolve.\nSimple Answering surveys Contacting representatives Moderate Attending city council meetings Canvassing / door knocking, \u0026 phone banking Attending demonstrations and protests Urbanist content creation High Event planning Organizing Getting Informed There are many places to get informed on Austin urbanism and find many things to do within both urbanist and urbanist-aligned causes.

Below you’ll find some common and flawed arguments and rebuttals to them. This is offered primarily for those curious about arguments they have heard against housing and who may be unaware of the evidence against each of these arguments. Anti-housing arguments are often rhetorical rather than factual, picked for their ability to persuade rather than inform. As we’ll see even a mild exploration of the data around housing shows that more housing makes homes more affordable while more public transit options and choices beyond car commuting makes getting around faster, more pleasant, and more equitable.\nEconomic Housing prices / Rent will continue to cost the same or increase This is simply false. Empirical evidence from Minneapolis to Germany show that building more housing lowers costs both for renting and owning.\nMinneapolis saw one of the largest recent decreases in both housing and inflation in general as a result of their choice to build more housing. They did this by eliminating exclusionary single family zoning and providing rental assistance and subsidies.\nIn May, the Twin Cities became the first major metropolitan area to see annual inflation fall below the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Its 1.8% pace of price increases was the lowest of any region that month. That’s largely due to a region-wide push to address one of the most intractable issues for both the Fed and American consumers: rising housing costs.\nSource: Bloomberg “First American City to Tame Inflation Owes Its Success to Affordable Housing” / archive.ph mirror\nSource: FT.com “Repeat after me: building any new homes reduces housing costs for all” / archive.ph mirror\nHappily Austin is not far behind, particularly among renters, as it has been encouraging the development of more apartment buildings which have overall lowered Austin rents by over 5% since last year; a reduction that far exceeds almost any other city in the US. To say nothing of US cities where rents continue to skyrocket due to restricted supply such as Madison, WI and Odessa, TX where rents are up by 9-14% over last year!\nSource: Twitter (@jayparsons)\nSimilarly home ownership costs have stayed low in Minneapolis, Houston, and other cities due to more relaxed zoning. Houston for example has small minimum lot sizes and no zoning for use which has resulted in their housing costs staying 17% below the national average despite being one of the largest cities in the US.\nSource: Houston.org “Housing cost comparison”\nMore generally this is how capitalism works. When artificial constraints are removed from markets and supply is allowed to naturally increase this brings down costs for people. It’s not magic, it’s not something that works the opposite of every other resource, it’s subject to the same supply and demand forces.\nHowever, not all housing affordability will or should be a result simply of market forces. In other cases we need our city to step in and ensure that the most in need have a safe, warm, and stable place to sleep every night, to engage with others, and to have friends over. All humans deserve this minimum of dignity and thankfully Austin has also implemented measures to help address this. You can read more about theses measures in the Affordable Housing section.\nProperty taxes will go up As you can see in the above topic if property values come down then so will property taxes as they’re a function of property values. However we have empirical evidence directly for this as well. For example Houston’s median property tax bill is $3,838 as of 2021 while Austin’s during the same period was $6,517 (Source: Taxfoundation.org; 2021 data at county-level). Effectively double the tax in large part due to restricted supply that has only started to ease in recent years.\nSimilarly in Connecticut towns that issued the most housing permits had their residents spending $4,900 less in property taxes than towns issuing few permits.\nCities cost too much Dense city centers create wealth in a city while car-centric suburbia destroys it.\nThis section/topic is incomplete. If you have some knowledge on this subject please help out by editing this page.\nInfrastructure No infrastructure is static and a building permit issued day 1 does not create a building on day 2. There are long lead times and many departments within the City of Austin who’s job it is to ensure infrastructure meets demand.\nThe roads can’t handle it This is correct but in the wrong way. Car-centric roads have never and will never handle capacity as well as every other mode of transportation does. The answer to the question of what to do about road capacity is not to limit housing, encourage sprawl, and further environmental destruction through car dependence. The answer is to provide better more convenient modes of transit, to build people’s basic necessities close to where they live, and to stop spending so much of our lives literally dying in traffic.\nCar dependence has resulted in yearly costs of:\n$26,000 of costs per household 40,000 deaths on US roads. 40,000 funerals. Countless devastated family members and friends 4,000,000,000 pounds of microplastics The solution then is to build infrastructure for public transit, biking, and walking. Check those articles to learn more.\nDid you know? 50% of all trips made in the US are 3 miles or less. These are easily reachable for most people with an e-bike or manual bike provided the infrastructure is available. Learn more. The water supply can’t handle it Austin, like most every major city in the US, has a water department that produces plans to address water needs well into the city’s future and provides annual progress reports. Austin Water itself has a 100-year plan termed “Water Forward” that the department is using to ensure the city has enough water.\nMore specifically within Austin when it comes to concerns about water supply we see:\nMulti-family homes are much more water efficient than single family homes A large reduction in the number of gallons of water pumped per capita per day since 2008 Water bills continuing to trend down relative to Austin’s Median Household Income On the first point, single family homes contribute to water waste while multi-family homes are more efficient per capita. According to the US Census and data from Austin Water (2019-2020), single family homes use roughly 20% more water per capita than Multi-family homes. Single family homes are simply less efficient with our water resources than multi-family homes. The chart below shows that both single and multi-family homes each made up about half of the population Austin, yet there are large differences in their water consumption.\nSources: US Census 2019 Estimates, and Austin Water “Residential Water Consumption” data set (Most recently available 12 month period: 2019-2020)\nAccording to the EPA Outdoor water use accounts for 30 percent of household use yet can be much higher in drier parts of the country and in more water-intensive landscapes The largest waste of water with single family homes is watering lawns full of bermuda grass and other non-native species that needs copious amounts of water to survive Texas summers. This is why we get notices to reduce lawn watering when Texas enters drought periods.\nSource: Austin Water “Drought Response”\nSo while people may make unfounded claims that our water crisis will get worse with more density, we actually see that the opposite is true:\nThat denser housing is much more efficient, while sprawl is more wasteful The solution to water concerns is not to ban housing but to restrict wasteful usage of our natural resources Austin Water “2022 Annual Progress Report”\nThe electric grid can’t handle it This section/topic is incomplete.

Most generally affordable housing can be broken down into two major categories:\nHousing affordability for people within a certain household income level as defined by the City of Austin Housing affordability for you, and others in a general sense Both of these are entirely legitimate concerns and ways to think about housing, so we’ll discuss them both and some of the ways in which affordability has been and can continue to be addressed. However it’s important to keep in mind that housing affordability is one large piece of a big puzzle that includes cost of transit, utilities, and services.\nCity of Austin Housing Affordability Initiatives Housing security is one of several important safety nets that are crucial to a healthy and functioning society. Towards this end cities often implement policies to help ensure people remain with housing and without undue hardship.\nWithin the city of Austin these initiatives have taken the form of:\nAffordability Unlocked VMU1/2 TOD/ETOD HOME SMART There are also federal programs which we won’t discuss here as they’re outside the scope of this article\nMedian Family Income The income levels mentioned below are based on Median Family Income (MFI). MFI is a measure of what the average household earns in the Austin-Round Rock area. The 100% MFI in 2022 was $88,250 for a family of 2 meaning half of all families earned less than this, and half earned more. This could be one family member earning $88,250, or 2 each earning $44,125, or any other split. Affordability Unlocked (AU) Affordability unlocked is a program created by the City of Austin in 2019 (original text, AU guide) to address housing affordability without subsidizing the housing with taxes. The plan achieves this by allowing developers who apply for Affordability Unlocked to build housing that is up to 25-50% taller than the current zoning limitations. This program is most commonly used in tandem with Multi-family zoning and VMU combining zoning districts along transit corridors where residents would have close and convenient access to public transit.\nIn practical terms this means that buildings using Affordability unlocked are able to build rentable and ownable housing for those living at or under 80% of the Median Family Income (MFI) of Austin’s citizens. Affordability Unlocked is further divided into two types, aptly called Type 1, and Type 2.\nUnder Type 1 at least half of all units built must be affordable. For rentals they must be kept affordable for a minimum of 40 years for those earning between 20% ($17,650) to 50% MFI ($44,150). For ownable units they must be kept affordable for a minimum of 99 years for those earning incomes averaging up to 80% MFI ($70,600).\nUnder Type 2 at least three quarters of all units must be affordable and meet all Type 1 requirements. In addition they must locate the building within a quarter-mile of a transit corridor and designate at least 10% of affordable housing for those earning under 30% MFI ($26,500).\nAs of 2023 over 3,000 units of housing have been built or are under construction with this program with another 3,000 units in the planning stages. Incredibly 80% of all planned and built housing units under this plan meet the affordability requirements of AU, exceeding the minimums set in place by the program.\nVertical Mixed Use Zoning (VMU1 \u0026 VMU2) Vertical Mixed Use zoning is a provision applied along major existing and future transit corridors with the goal of getting more of Austin’s citizens close to transit with mixed-use development that provides both housing and retail development. This zoning addresses affordability in multiple ways:\nAllowing for more units of housing to be built along these corridors Placing homes closer to current and future affordable transit options Creating easier access to the daily conveniences people need The original VMU zoning (VMU1) was introduced in 2010 and allowed for reducing setbacks, mixed use development (residential and commercial), and reduced parking minimums along with other considerations that allow for denser housing. Along with this VMU1 set out small allowances of 10% affordable housing for rental and ownership developments.\nVMU1 has thus far succeeded in creating over 100 new buildings under this zoning and as such was expanded with VMU2 that allows for buildings zoned for high density multifamily residences (MF-6) to reach 90 feet in height by right (ie. by default). VMU1 buildings are typically limited to 60 feet or less. Both VMU1 and VMU2 can be kept lower due to compatibility restrictions.\nEquitable Transit Oriented Development (TOD / ETOD) This section/topic is incomplete. If you have some knowledge on this subject please help out by editing this page.\nHome Options for Middle-income Empowerment (HOME) One of the key hindrances to housing affordability is the availability of housing. Within Austin, and most US cities, supply has been artificially restricted for over half a century. Today Austin has a housing code (aka Land Development Code) that was last updated in the 1980s with the idea that it’s important to keep property sizes very large, and housing very limited, so that only those with high means can enjoy living here.\nHOME is an initiative very much representative of today’s generational housing conflict. It’s currently (as of Oct 2023) being considered by City Council with overwhelming support while simultaneously being the target of anti-housing activists.\nHOME allows for the building of more housing and better neighborhoods by:\nReducing residential minimum lot sizes from 5,750 sq ft to 2,500 sq ft. Allowing up to 3 units of housing to be built on a lot without additional zoning changes to the lot Quite literally the city council wants to do what urbanists have been asking of it. Enable more neighborhoods to follow the design principles of livable, walkable, nice areas. Transforming what is currently a limited luxury for the well off of our city into something that everyone who lives in Austin can enjoy. This doesn’t mean all of our neighborhoods will end up looking like any specific place, just that we’ll have more flexibility in what we build and who we build it for.\nMinimum Lot Size Austin’s minimum lot size will still remain quite big relative to nearby cities. Houston for example has a minimum lot size of 1,400 sq ft! SMART This section/topic is incomplete. If you have some knowledge on this subject please help out by editing this page.\nHousing Affordability in General Housing affordability in general requires a multi-pronged approach so that housing prices can be brought down to a point where they are affordable to those living above the income levels defined by CoA. It’s not hard to see how even those earning $100,000+ a year are struggling to afford housing. Housing affordability across the US has dropped steeply and this is driven by many factors including:\nInterest rates on loans Severe zoning restrictions on housing Parking minimums on new construction Tax structures which disincentivize building housing Compatibility restrictions Unrealistic lot size minimums Deed restrictions “Valid Petition” laws Interest rates on loans Much like with the student loan crisis the housing affordability crisis is affected by the availability of loans and low interest rates. However this is a very complex topic and outside the scope of a guide to urbanism as it is not something urbanism can solve directly. Within the context of housing urbanism is principally concerned with the supply side of the housing market (ie. the total amount of homes available for people to live in) while interest rates primarily influence the demand side of the housing market (ie. money people have to purchase property). Furthermore the situation our housing market is in, particularly on the limited supply side of housing, has not been seen before in the US and as such what we know historically about interest rates, loans, and housing may no longer apply.\nOf course no understanding of the situation we are in is complete without some understanding of the effect interest rates have on housing costs so here’s a few resources if you’re interested. Just know that this subject is tangential to urbanism rather than central. Urbanism doesn’t need to address interest rates to fix the housing crisis.\nHow Interest Rates Affect Property Values How Higher Mortgage Rates Have Historically Affected Home Prices Can Home Prices and Interest Rates Soar at the Same Time? Zoning restrictions on housing Austin, like most US cities, has an overwhelming amount of its residential living space is zoned exclusively for single family free standing homes on large lots. Within Austin the minimum lot size you can currently build a single family home on is 5,750 square feet and within that lot you can only build a house and other impervious ground cover on 40% of it. 60% of your lot must be left as unused space. This is leading to various crises in the housing market ranging from entire generations of young people being priced out of affordable housing to older generations living alone in large homes and unable to find smaller homes to down size to.\nParking minimums This section/topic is incomplete.

With every bike lane added, with every person out riding bikes, drivers and people in general become more familiar with, aware of, and supportive of biking as a form of commute.\nBiking is not just healthy but also offers many other benefits:\nIt’s much cheaper than driving. Even an e-bike uses just 5-10 cents of electricity per charge and a typical e-bike has a range of 30-60 miles. It’s significantly less strain on infrastructure. Bikes cause almost zero damage to roads. Larger, heavier vehicles are responsible for road damage. Biking is generally a much more pleasant experience than driving. You feel a lot more present, more attached to the world around you, people wave and smile, and you simply move around at more human and lower stressed speeds. Getting Around Biking in Austin is becoming more and more accessible with over 230 miles already built. With every bike lane we add we get more and more people out enjoying a simply more pleasant way of commuting.\nIt’s also important to note that not every commute is fit for biking and keeping your safety and comfort in mind is always the most important thing. Manual biking is most suitable to trips of 3 miles or less which make up over half of all trips!\nMore distance With e-bikes your possible biking range is extended considerably and 80% of trips are 10 miles or less! So if you want to start biking check out the links below to find a bike, or start planning routes and finding things that are reasonable and comfortable for you to reach.\nAAA Bike Network The city of Austin has planned out an All Ages and Abilities network with the goal of creating over 800 miles of bike lanes across Austin. You can find plans, analysis, and maps of the city’s biking network within their AAA biking network tool here. It’s a great place to get started with seeing what bike lanes are near you.\nScroll through to find regularly updated maps of what’s been finished, what’s currently being built, and what’s coming!

Austin’s current compatibility restrictions are such that:\nA building within 50 feet of a SFH’s lot cannot be more than 40 feet tall. A building within 300 feet of a SFH’s lot cannot be more than 60 feet tall. Source: Findings and Recommendations for Implementing Ordinance No. 20221201-056 Regarding Compatibility Regulations, Sept 5 2023\nEffectively this means that tens of thousands of homes are currently illegal to build in Austin even in areas that are zoned for slightly denser housing. If you’ve ever noticed buildings within Austin that look like steps, getting progressively taller/shorter, this is compatibility. An artificial, and inequitable restriction on the amount of housing that can be built.\nAustin compatibility is also atypically extreme compared to most other cities. As shown in this chart where Austin has decided that the presence of a single family home can affect housing that is being built 2 blocks away.\nSource: Findings and Recommendations for Implementing Ordinance No. 20221201-056 Regarding Compatibility Regulations, Sept 5 2023\nEffects of Compatibility The failure of compatibility does not stop at simply housing. It also has effects on transportation, equity, the environment, and car dependency.\nA recent study by the City of Austin on Compatibility Regulations (September, 2023) found that 135,000 housing units are lost in areas already zoned for high density due to compatibility rules. 110,000 of the lost units (82%) are within 1/4th of a mile of an existing transit stop.\nCompatibility triggers even when no homes exist on a lot. It requires that if an area is zoned for single family housing then that is enough to restrict what can be built by it. In this way almost completely empty pieces of land, such as the one pictured below, limit what housing can be built around it.\nThe less dense we can build in places intended for density the less efficient we can make public transit. The less practical we make walking and biking the more we force people into their cars and onto highways to live out their basic needs. The more we inhibit progress on making it possible to live in an environmentally friendly way the worse off we will be. The minor and petty sensibilities of someone who doesn’t like slightly taller buildings should not even be a consideration and yet it is currently central to controlling how Austinites are allowed to live.\n","categories":"","description":"Compatibility is a way for owners of single family homes to control what others do with their homes and neighborhood.

TTC is a state-wide body of 5 political appointees that plans and authorizes 10 year transportation plans (aka UTPs) at a state level. These plans then get passed to TxDOT who must work with CAMPO to identify projects, funding, and finally approve plans that achieve the goals of the UTP. Collectively they represent a destructive, unrepresentative, and undemocratic force of will of the oil and gas industry to carve up our cities and environment for profit.\nPreface: The Cost of Highways and Roads The true cost of highways and roads is almost never discussed when it comes to budgeting within the US. The necessity of an ever larger amount of road and all their economic, social, and environmental costs are simply taken as-is.\nOn the economic side of the equation roads cost the average household $14,000 per year regardless of if they own a car or not. When factoring in car ownership the cost nearly doubles to $26,000 per household per year on average for the total cost of using roads. We need to ask the question of whether or not we should be paying such astronomical costs for the car economy when more affordable, cleaner, and safer alternatives exist.\nOn the environmental side, beyond burning fossil fuels, car tires are the second largest source of primary microplastics in our environment producing 3,962,765,390 pounds (1,797,480 tonnes) of microplastic pollution per year. The US is also the single largest per capita creator of tire-based microplastics due to how much we drive.\nTexas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) The Texas Department of Transportation is the state’s department that plans and implements roads for cars and trucks on ROWs that they own or have access to use. In principal a Department Of Transportation should create transportation options for all modes of transportation. However in practice and in law they spend almost all of their funding on road expansions.\nTxDOT road expansions include highways as well as many regular streets within cities and towns that they also own. This means that in some cases urbanist efforts to improve certain roads are frustrated by the state’s desire to harm its people over petty grievances. Due to this fatal crashes on state owned roadways continue to rise, while on non-state roads fatalities have remained flat.\nSource: Austin Vision Zero Update, May 25 2023\nTxDOT Funding Proposition 1: Directs 37.5% of existing oil and natural gas production taxes (aka severance) to TxDOT so that “the funds may only be used for constructing, maintaining, and acquiring rights-of-way for public roadways other than toll roads.”\nProposition 7: Directs portions of state sales and use taxes, as well as motor vehicle sale and rental taxes to: “(1) construct, maintain, or acquire rights of way for public roadways other than toll roads; or (2) repay the principal of and interest on general obligation bonds issued as authorized by Section 49-p, Article III, of this constitution.”\nIn combination these two propositions have lead to tens of billions of state tax dollars being directed towards maintaining and expanding highways and all the negatives that car dependent infrastructure brings to us and our cities.\nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program: This is a federal program which says when a state fails to meet their obligations under the Clean Air Act they can be awarded funding to improve their compliance. However this bill also allows up to 50% of funding to be redirected to other highway and transportation activities. The end result being that states are able to use funding intended for improving our air quality to instead construct additional highways and roads.\n“A State may transfer up to 50% of CMAQ funds made available each fiscal year to any other apportionment of the State, including the National Highway Performance Program, Surface Transportation Block Grant Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program, National Highway Freight Program [..]”\nCapital Area Metropolitan Planning Authority (CAMPO) Per the CAMPO website:\nThe Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization is the metropolitan planning organization for Bastrop, Burnet, Caldwell, Hays, Travis, and Williamson Counties. MPOs are federally required throughout the country in areas with a population of 50,000 or more and are required to produce a 20+ year transportation plan, called a Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), and a four-year planning document called the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).\nCAMPO is governed by a 21-member Transportation Policy Board, made up of 19 elected officials and a representative from TxDOT and one from Capital Metro. The Policy Board is the body that makes decisions on CAMPO policy and decides how CAMPO funding is allocated.\nCAMPO Representation Austin’s 2022 population of 974,447 (2022; US Census Estimate) makes up 39% of the total population represented within CAMPO yet this 21 member board contains only 4 members from Austin which means that Austin’s overall voting and decision making power is significantly lower than its population size. This leads to poor decision making that negatively impacts Austin because our needs are not adequately represented.\nFurther reducing Ausin’s influence and proper representation within CAMPO is the Transportation Policy Board Executive Committee. This 9 member board is the body that makes recommendations to the full TPB board about plans, projects, and issues. Not a single member of this committee is from Austin.\nThere doesn’t yet exist a movement in Austin to fix CAMPO so that it is fairly representative or so that Austin can have its own MPO. However similar efforts have been taken up in neighboring cities like the Fair For Houston initiative. A similar initiative could be done in Austin.\nIn addition to CAMPO’s lack of proper representation for Austin it also actively excludes members of the public by:\nLocating their meetings at the Junior League on Texas 360 Loop which excludes anyone who commutes without a car from attending. Accessibility to this meeting will get even worse over the next 5 years due to two major highway projects on Loop 360 and Spicewood Springs Road. Holding all meetings at 2pm on weekdays without an option to dial-in. Effectively excluding anyone who works a daytime job for a living. Requiring all speakers to attend in person; no option to dial in to comment. Texas Transportation Commission (TTC) The final piece to the puzzle of how transportation gets built in is the TTC. They are a small body of 5 political appointees that make 10 year plans for CAMPO and TxDOT to fund and implement.\nThis section/topic is incomplete.

These laws largely make it illegal to build anything other than single family homes in most areas of most of the US and intentionally relegate more affordable styles of housing to far away areas and beside noisy highways with poor air quality and little options to go outside.\nUrbanists seek to reform these laws so that more varied types of housing can be built in more locations. While results will vary depending on the type of reform, in general these types of reforms can result in more affordable housing, walkable and friendly neighborhoods, and more diversity of income within a single neighborhood.\nBig picture these reforms seek to make a neighborhood more like a neighborhood and less like a series of large expensive pods where neighbors can’t easily interact.\nTo put it another way, these reforms seek to be big tent where if someone wants to live in a single family house they certainly can but they do not get to say that their neighborhood should exclude young adults, service workers, or first responders on the basis of income.\nToday many cottages, townhouses, apartment buildings, condos, and other housing get relegated to specially designated areas. Any amenities they have, such as a park, or local walkable grocery, are cut off by distance and roads from the rest of the town or city.\nHousing reform is all about sharing a vibrant neighborhood with your neighbors rather than cutting out your own tiny and uninteresting sliver.\nGood Transportation Urbanism takes the realistic stance that a car dependent society has been a significant failure in many aspects of life, from smog and health, to loneliness and isolation, to thousands of hours wasted in traffic, to 40,000 yearly traffic fatalities and 2,500,000 injuries. Someone you know, care about, or love will be seriously injured or killed on a road at some point in your life. It is a statistical inevitability. Many times when this happens we will blame the driver, or call it an “accident” but the true cause of this unnecessary suffering is undoubtedly car dependence.\nWhile cars are still necessary urbanism seeks to reform our car dependent society and shift to multimodal transportation which reduces our need for cars. This includes making space and improvements for bus lanes, bike lanes, trains, walking, and hoverboards once science catches up. Many of our towns and cities today are hostile to non-car transportation. Lacking shade, sidewalks, and safe street crossings they are wholly unfit for most people most of the time.\nUrbanism also seeks to make things safer and faster for cars, manual laborers, and emergency vehicles. By getting drivers off the road when they don’t need to be our roads become less occupied with cars and reduce traffic. With less cars on the road maintenance is also reduced and the occurrence of potholes and need to repave roads becomes less frequent.\nMuch like housing, the urbanist approach to road safety is also big tent. Some people will need to use roads for their job or for particularly remote travel or just because they like driving on open roads every so often. That’s perfectly fine but we must make our roads less crowded and safer.\nHuman Scale Neighborhoods Most US neighborhoods are built at car scale rather than human scale. They prioritize placing housing separate from spaces such as parks, groceries, restaurants, and all other types of places where people like to gather. They create long travel distances for the types of things that replenish everything from your fridge to your soul.\nHuman scale neighborhoods seek to bring these necessities of life closer to where people live. Allowing people to easily bump into their neighbors. To get that missing ingredient they need for tonight’s dinner. Or hop on a bus to and from a restaurant without worrying about parking, expensive taxis. Closer amenities make our roads less busy, reduce our climate impact, and drop drunk driving rates.\nFairness Our cities unfortunately have a history of unfair treatment depending on who you are and where you live. These issues are many and vast, some of the most salient of which are:\nRedlining: The wholesale exclusion of racial and ethnic minority neighborhoods from financial services such as home loans. Segregation by design: How local governments through policy and actions forced our cities and neighborhoods to be segregated. Such as the destruction of Black American and immigrant neighborhoods to build highways as physical barriers separating former neighbors. The habit of wealthy neighbors to advocate for moving whatever they don’t want to less fortunate neighborhoods. Urbanists seek to address these issues by supporting laws, projects, and protests that address a wide variety of equity concerns.\n","categories":"","description":"Urbanists want housing reform, good transportation, human scale neighborhoods, and fairness for all of their city's residents.\n","excerpt":"Urbanists want housing reform, good transportation, human scale …","ref":"/getting_started/what_urbanists_want/","tags":"","title":"What Urbanists Want"}]
