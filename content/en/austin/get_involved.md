  There are numerous ways to get yourself more involved in supporting urbanist causes. The first steps of which are knowing who you are, what you care about, and getting informed.

## Who You Are

Being informed about urbanist issues involves finding groups and sources of information that can help you find what to act on. Everyone cares about different aspects of urbanism be it housing, equity, public transit, bike lanes, safety, etc. Lean into this.

Being an urbanist does not require that you know and do everything. There are many of us. If we each pick and do what we're most interested in then the overall goals of urbanism will be better for it. Doing urbanism is mostly volunteer and unpaid work so if you're going to do it you may as well like either the work, the outcome, or both.

## What do urbanists do?

Urbanists make their voice heard. It may sound simple or cheesy but this is what anti-urbanists do and it's why our neighborhoods are put together so poorly and unfairly. We are going to change this.

We do this in a variety of ways that vary from low effort to high effort. Start where you want but we suggest starting with simple, low effort actions to dip your toes, familiarize yourself, and build from there. All of these efforts can and do have a high impact on how our cities and towns evolve.

- Simple
  - Answering surveys
  - Contacting representatives
- Moderate
  - Attending city council meetings
  - Canvassing / door knocking, & phone banking
  - Attending demonstrations and protests
  - Urbanist content creation
- High
  - Event planning
  - Organizing

## Getting Informed

There are many places to get informed on Austin urbanism and find many things to do. A non-exhaustive list is below. If you know of something we missed [please let us know here](https://github.com/zeezephyr/urbanism-guide/discussions/23#discussion-5695516).
