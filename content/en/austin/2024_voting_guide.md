## The Importance of Voting

Present day Texas state law makes it crucial to have a supermajority of pro-housing and pro-transportation council members on city council due to a provision known as a "valid petition" which gives property owners special rights that other Texas citizens do not have. Under this law property owners can stop rezoning of any land within 200 feet of their property provided that those petitioning own at least 20% of the land.

Renters do not get this right, 80% of land owners cannot petition in favor of a rezoning that would build housing or improve transportation. A single large landowner can dictate what an entire neighborhood is capable of doing. The landlord of a large apartment complex gets more say over what is built nextdoor than the hundreds of people who live there.

However "valid petitions" cannot overcome a three-fourths supermajority ruling by City Council. In these cases the City Council is able to override the valid petition. Within the context of Austin this means that any improvement which is legally challenged must have a 9-2 supermajority.

This is not academic. An anti-housing lawsuit representing just 1.4% of the city's population very recently [overturned multiple rezonings](https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2023/11/city-loses-second-suit-over-development-rules/). This lawsuit would have also overturned what is arguably Austin's [best affordable housing initiative](/austin/housing/affordable_housing/#affordability-unlocked-au). It survived solely due to a procedural issue.

> Unlike in other states, Texas’ petition law now endangers citywide rezonings, thanks to a 2022 court opinion in City of Austin v. Acuña that blocked Austin from overhauling its own zoning (which was done to comply with its comprehensive plan, as paradoxically required under state law). In that case, a mere 1.4 percent of the city’s population was enough to force the supermajority at city council per the valid petition law. The court’s ruling jeopardizes future zoning overhauls in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals District and casts a shadow over any Texas city’s efforts to comprehensively rezone.

More can be done to overhaul and fix Texas' broken "valid petition" law but until that happens it is absolutely vital that anyone who cares about housing even slightly get out and vote for pro-housing candidates.

## District 10

Alison Alter is also term-limited and cannot run for reelection. CM A Alter recently voted along with Mackenzie Kelly to oppose HOME and the elimination of parking mandates.
