    The US's Federal, State, and Local governments spent nearly a century intentionally creating segregated communities in the US. Read on to scratch the surface on this tragic history.

Housing segregation is neither natural nor unique to Austin. Rather it is something that has been intentionally created and enforced through local, state, and federal laws and agencies. It took every conceivable form and its remnants continue to exist today. Our country's wounds are deep, have not ended, and they still have long to heal.

The forms it took are as numerous and creative as you can imagine. From local [racial and euclidean zoning](/austin/housing/zoning_restrictions), neighborhood associations, and racial deed restrictions (aka. covenants). To state and country-wide highway expansion. To federal housing loans, public housing, and redlining. To the free market exploiting segregation in the form of blockbusting, contract sales, and 2008's subprime mortgage crisis. Racist and exclusionary housing practices are not over either; recently [Navy FCU was accused of systematically denying loan applications](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/14/business/navy-federal-credit-union-black-applicants-invs/index.html) to qualified Black Americans who served in our armed forces.

Intentional and legalized housing segregation continues to plague our cities and towns today.

## A Note on The Impacts on People

Below we describe the significant ways that our government and society created segregation both in Austin and throughout the US. But equally important is to keep in mind how the people who were victims of these policies were forced to live. They were living in poorly constructed housing which were intentionally placed far from work and "white" society. Despite this they'd often be paying much more for housing than other Americans due to limited options, and higher interest rates (5.5% to 9% higher). As a result they'd often be forced to work multiple jobs, take on extra roommates, and have little time or energy to maintain their already poorly constructed housing. They'd have their roads less paved, their sewers less serviced, and all other utilities neglected.

Many racist stereotypes that exist today come from these conditions. Conditions that are not intrinsic but forced on Black Americans and immigrant populations throughout our history. But as is often the case in America, Black Americans always seem to get the worst of it.

## Deed Restrictions / Racial Covenants

If you live in a single family home on the west side of Austin it is very likely that your property has a deed restriction. It's likely old, filed with the city, and was provided by your title company when you closed on your home. It may detail various things you can and cannot do with your propety from upkeep, to the colors you can paint your home, and the skin color or ethnicity of who is allowed to live in it.

![An excerpt of a deed restriction that reads "No part of the premises of property covered hereby ever shall be rented, leased, sold, demised or conveyed to, or otherwise become the property of, or into the possession of, any persons other than white persons of strict Caucasian blood."](/media/racist_deed_restrictions.png)

Such restrictions as the one featured above were legal until [1948 when the Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kramer ruled them illegal](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/shelley_v_kraemer_(1948)). Except that the Federal Housing Authority which issued home loans kept issuing them to land owners who had racial covenants in their deed restrictions. This practice continued for over a year until Philip Perlman, the US Solicitor General, instituted a policy that prevented the FHA from giving out loans to such properties starting on February 15, 1950. This announcement was given with a grace period presumably so that racists could rush in any remaining racial covenants before the deadline and be grandfathered in.

Except it didn't end here either. These covenants were then quickly replaced with prohibitively expensive "damages" that would be charged to land owners who violated a deed restriction and sold land or housing to non-whites. The Supreme Court banned this circumvention in the [1953 case Barrows v. Jackson](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/249/).

Despite the ultimate unenforceability of any racial covenants in deed restrictions post-1953 they were still able to be included in deed restrictions until a federal appeals court ruled in 1972 that they violated the Fair Housing Act. If they couldn't be enforced such racist covenants could at least clearly communicate to would-be home buyers who was welcome and who was not.
