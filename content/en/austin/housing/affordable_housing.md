    Learn how Austin is doing to make housing more affordable and what more can be done.

Affordable housing is a term that has many meanings depending on who you're talking to and what you're talking about.
Most generally affordable housing can be broken down into two major categories:

1. Housing affordability for people within a certain household income level as defined by the City of Austin
1. Housing affordability for you, and others in a general sense

Both of these are entirely legitimate concerns and ways to think about housing, so let's get into them.

## Housing Affordability as Defined by CoA

Housing security is one of several important safety nets that are crucial to a healthy and functioning society.
Towards this end cities often implement policies to help ensure people remain with housing and without undue hardship.

Within the city of Austin these initiatives have taken the form of:

- Affordability Unlocked
- VMU1/2??
- SMART

### Affordability Unlocked

[Affordability unlocked](https://www.austintexas.gov/department/affordability-unlocked-development-bonus-program) is a program created by the City of Austin in 2019 ([original text](https://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=319975), [AU guide](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Housing/AU_Applicant_Guide_FINAL_1019.pdf)) to address housing affordability without subsidizing the housing with taxes. The plan achieves this by allowing developers who apply for Affordability Unlocked to build housing that is up to 25-50% taller than the current zoning limitations. This program is most commonly used in tandem with Multi-family zoning and [VMU combining zoning districts](https://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=383601) along transit corridors where residents would have close and convenient access to public transit.

The income levels mentioned below are based on Median Family Income (MFI). MFI is a measure of what the average family earns in the Austin-Round Rock area. The MFI in 2022 was $88,250 for a family of 2.

The full chart of [figures from 2022 is here](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Housing_%26_Planning/MFI%20Chart%20Effective_2022.pdf).

In practical terms this means that buildings using Affordability unlocked are able to build rentable and ownable housing for those living at or under 80% of the Median Famiy Income (MFI) of Austin's citizens. Affordability Unlocked is further divided into two types, aptly called Type 1, and Type 2.

Under Type 1 at least half of all units built must be affordable. For rentals they must be kept affordable for a minimum of 40 years for those earning between 20% ($17,650) to 50% MFI ($44,150). For ownable units they must be kept affordable for a minimum of 99 years for those earning incomes averaging up to 80% MFI ($70,600).

Under Type 2 at least three quarters of all units must be affordable and meet all Type 1 requirements. In addition they must locate the building within a quarter-mile of a transit corridor and designate at least 10% of affordable housing for those earning under 30% MFI ($26,500).

As of 2023 over 3,000 units of housing have been built or are under construction with this program with another 3,000 units in the planning stages. Incredibly 80% of all planned and built housing units under this plan meet the affordability requirements of AU, exceeding the minimums set in place by the program.

### Vertical Mixed Use Zoning

[Vertical Mixed Use zoning](https://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=383601) is a provision applied along major existing and future transit corridors with the goal of getting more of Austin's citizens close to transit. 

TODO: Is this even affordability?

### SMART


## Housing Affordability in General

Housing affordability in general requires a multipronged approach so that housing prices can be brought down to a point where
they are affordable to those living above the income levels defined by CoA. It's not hard to see how even those earning $100,000+ a year
are struggling to afford housing. Housing affordability across the US has dropped steeply and this is driven by many factors including:

1. Interest rates on loans
1. Severe zoning restrictions on housing
1. Parking minimums on new construction
1. Tax structures which disincentivize building housing
1. Compatibility restrictions
1. Unrealistic lot size minimums
1. Deed restrictions
1. "Valid Petition" laws
