Affordable housing is a term that has many meanings depending on who you're talking to and what you're talking about.
Most generally affordable housing can be broken down into two major categories:

1. Housing affordability for people within a certain household income level as defined by the City of Austin
1. Housing affordability for you, and others in a general sense

Both of these are entirely legitimate concerns and ways to think about housing, so let's get into them.

## Housing Affordability as Defined by CoA

Housing security is one of several important safety nets that are crucial to a healthy and functioning society.
Towards this end cities often implement safety nets of their own to ensure people remain with housing and without undue hardship.

Within the city of Austin these initiatives have taken the form of:
- Affordability Unlocked
- VMU 1 & VMU 2

## Housing Affordability in General

Housing affordability in general requires a multipronged approach so that housing prices can be brought down to a point where
they are affordable to those living above the income levels defined by CoA. It's not hard to see how even those earning $100,000+ a year
are struggling to afford housing. Housing affordability across the US has dropped steeply and this is driven by many factors including:

1. Low interest rates on loans
1. Severe zoning restrictions on housing
1. Parking minimums on new construction
1. Tax structures which disincentivize building housing
1. Compatibility restrictions
1. Unrealistic lot size minimums
1. Deed restrictions
1. "Valid Petition" laws
