Zoning is one of the strongest invisible forces that shapes our cities and neighborhoods. But what is zoning? How and why did it come about? And what are the issues around it?

## A "Brief" History of Zoning

Government mandated and enforced racial segregation stretches from the founding of our country until it was legally ended in 1964 and 1965 with the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. Brown v. Board of education, Jim Crow, and similar signposts of our history are often taught in history classes (I hope). Less talked about is the issue of zoning and its indirect approach to achieving many of the same outcomes that many of us wish were solely in our past.

Racial segregation, or rather racial zoning, was legal within the US until 1917 when William Warley, a NAACP lawyer, prompted a [Supreme Court case in 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchanan_v._Warley). The Justices ultimately ruled that excluding Black Americans from White neighborhoods infringed upon White land-owner's right to sell their property to whomever they wished. Thus any race based zoning was now illegal and unenforceable throughout the US. But it didn't stop people from trying.

> Blacks should be quarantined in isolated slums in order to reduce the incidence of civil disturbance, to prevent the spread of communicable disease into nearby white neighborhoods, and to **protect property values** among the White majority

### Euclidean Zoning

While the 1917 Supreme Court case was yet to be decided the end of racial zoning ordinances loomed large. The Supreme Court might soon change these policies, yet the attitude of the US's citizens had not shifted. Many wanted a way to sidestep this decision. Thus the Fifth Avenue Association spearheaded a campaign termed "Save New York" in an effort to remove primarily Jewish and Italian garment workers from Fifth Avenue.

> At the opening of the 20th century, tens of thousands of garment workers began to clog the streets of Fifth Avenue, strolling and window-shopping, and meeting informally to discuss the vagaries of the trade. For property and business owners along Fifth Avenue, however, the workers constituted nothing short of an immigrant horde that had to be stopped.

The campaign's goals succeeded and thus the first modern [Euclidean zoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning_in_the_United_States#Euclidean) law was enacted in New York on July 25, 1916. This zoning law, however, was not based on race or ethnic lines but rather industry with the ultimate goal being the same: those seen as lesser were pushed elsewhere.

This new style of zoning quickly spread throughout the US. In fact the first Supreme Court case, [Euclid v. Amber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_of_Euclid_v._Ambler_Realty_Co.), was heard in 1926. The case concerned the Village of Euclid's new zoning law designed to keep "industrial Cleveland" from changing the "character of the village". While a lower court determined that Euclid's zoning law was unconstitutional the Supreme Court ultimately sided with the village and upheld the exclusionary zoning.

### A City Plan for Austin

Just a few years later Austin would pen its first planning document in 1928, ["A City Plan for Austin, Texas"](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/65853?show=full) that included bountiful amenities for its white residents, and segregation for its black residents who would be pushed to the East side and then forgotten about. According to ["The Color of Law" by Richard Rothstein](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/the-color-of-law) their roads would be left less paved, their sewers unmaintained and clogged, and their bus routes suspended in the summer.

> Streets would be widened and paved to account for increasing automobile use (Austinites were already complaining about traffic in 1928). Boulevards would be sculpted and lined with trees. Playgrounds and parks would be built within a half-mile walk of every person in the city [...]
>
> And black Austinites would be shunted into a new “negro district.”

Over time more approaches to zoning were devised such as surreptitious [increases to minimum lot sizes](https://www.austinpolitics.net/a-big-win-for-small-lots/) from none up until 1929 to 3,000 square feet in 1930, then 3,500 in 1941, and a whopping 5,750 in 1946. Lot sizes were then paired with the creation of single family zoning, setbacks, and so on. Each of these policies enacted with the singular goal of excluding Black, Brown, and other non-White Americans from home ownership by making it prohibitively expensive for them to own property within White neighborhoods.

And thus we find ourselves with the result: two Austins. One of which has benefited immensely from repeatedly pushing everything it doesn't want to the East side and one that has suffered this perverse proclivity at every turn. When anti-housing advocates ask to only upzone the East side or to build further and further away they ask to simply continue the same segregationist policies that they city has practiced for nearly 100 years.
