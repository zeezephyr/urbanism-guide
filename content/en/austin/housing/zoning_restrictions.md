Zoning is one of the strongest invisible forces that shapes our cities and neighborhoods. But what is zoning? How and why did it come about? And what are the issues around it?

## A Brief History of Zoning

The first US zoning law was enacted in New York on July 25, 1916 in an attempt to remove immigrant workers from Fifth Avenue. At the time many immigrants of primarily Italian and Jewish descent worked in the Fifth Avenue Garment District. Thus a campaign termed "Save New York" was spearheaded by Robert Cooke, president of the Fifth Avenue Association which pushed this discriminatory law. In just a few short months almost all garment workers had been moved out of Fifth Avenue.

> At the opening of the 20th century, tens of thousands of garment workers began to clog the streets of Fifth Avenue, strolling and window-shopping, and meeting informally to discuss the vagaries of the trade. For property and business owners along Fifth Avenue, however, the workers constituted nothing short of an immigrant horde that had to be stopped.

Intolerance within NYC did not end within the borders of Fifth Avenue, instead the workers found similar hostility throughout the city. Thus the famous racists of the era found themselves in a conundrum, they loved their cheaply produced garments by overworked and mistreated laborers but they hated the laborers. What they wanted was to segregate them from the rest of NY society; rather than use zoning as a method of exclusion they'd now turn to using it as means of containment. Thus the FAA and city government created a manufacturing zone in what is now part of the Tenderloin district.

Zoning spread quite successfully throughout the US after this. In fact the first Supreme Court case, [Euclid v. Amber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_of_Euclid_v._Ambler_Realty_Co.), was heard in 1926. The case concerned the Village of Euclid's new zoning law designed to keep "industrial Cleveland" from changing the "character of the village". While a lower court determined that Euclid's zoning law was unconstitutional the Supreme Court ultimately sided with the village and upheld the exclusionary [Euclidean Zoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning_in_the_United_States#Euclidean).

Just a few years later Austin would pen its first planning document in 1928, ["A City Plan for Austin, Texas"](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/65853?show=full) that included bountiful amenities for its white residents, and segregation for its black residents.

And thus we find ourselves with the result: two Austins. One of which has benefited immensely from repeatedly pushing everything it doesn't want to the East side and one that has suffered it at every turn. When anti-housing advocates ask to only upzone the East side or to build further and further away they ask to simply continue the same segregationist policies that they've practiced for nearly 100 years.
