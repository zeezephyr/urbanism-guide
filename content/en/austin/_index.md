Austin, like all cities and towns, is unique in its culture, laws, location, government, and way of doing things. Like all places it has its good and its bad, and as with any city or town its urbanism must end up tailored to it, it's people, and their concerns.

In this section we will largely explain Austin's laws and regulations. Both the good, the bad, and the nonsense. They include: 

- [Vision Zero](/austin/transportation/vision_zero)
- [Project Connect](/austin/transportation/project_connect)
- [Affordable Housing](/austin/housing/affordable_housing)
- [Restrictive Zoning](/austin/housing/restrictive_zoning)
- [Compatibility Restrictions](/austin/housing/compatibility_restrictions)
- [TxDOT and CAMPO](/austin/transportation/highways)
- And more. Check out the side bar for the full list.
