TxDOT, CAMPO, and the TTC are the three organizations and political bodies that are responsible for our mess of deadly highways. TTC is a state-wide body of 5 political appointees that plans and authorizes 10 year transportation plans (aka UTPs) at a state level. These plans then get passed to TxDOT who must work with CAMPO to identify projects, funding, and finally approve plans that achieve the goals of the UTP.

## Preface: The Cost of Highways and Roads

The true cost of highways and roads is almost never discussed when it comes to budgeting within the US. The necessity of an ever larger amount of road and all their economic, social, and environmental costs are simply taken as-is. On the economic side of the equation roads cost the average househould $14,000 per year regardless of if they own a car or not. When factoring in car ownership the cost nearly doubles to [$26,000 per household per year on average for the total cost of using roads](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/01/massachusetts-car-economy-costs-64-billion-study-finds/). We need to ask the question of whether or not we should be paying such astronomical costs for the car economy when more affordable, cleaner, and safer alternatives exist.

## Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)

The Texas Department of Transportation is the state's department that plans and implements roads for cars and trucks on ROWs that they own or have access to use. In principal a Department Of Transportation _should_ create transportation options for all modes of transportation. However in practice and in law they spend almost all of their funding on road expansions.

TxDOT road expansions include highways as well as many regular streets within cities and towns that they also own. This means that in some cases urbanist efforts to improve certain roads are frustrated by the state's desire to harm its people over petty grievances. Due to this fatal crashes on state owned roadways continue to rise, while on non-state roads fatalities have remained flat.

### TxDOT Funding

- [Proposition 1](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3/CN.3.49-g.v2.htm): Directs 37.5% of existing oil and natural gas production taxes (aka severance) to TxDOT so that "the funds may only be used for constructing, maintaining, and acquiring rights-of-way for public roadways other than toll roads."

- [Proposition 7](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.8/CN.8.7-c.htm): Directs portions of state sales and use taxes, as well as motor vehicle sale and rental taxes to: "(1) construct, maintain, or acquire rights of way for public roadways other than toll roads; or (2) repay the principal of and interest on general obligation bonds issued as authorized by Section 49-p, Article III, of this constitution."

In combination these propositions have lead to tens of billions of state tax dollars being directed towards maintaining and expanding highways and all the negativies that car dependent infrastructure brings to us and our cities.

## Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Authority (CAMPO)

Per the CAMPO website:

> The Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization is the metropolitan planning organization for Bastrop, Burnet, Caldwell, Hays, Travis, and Williamson Counties. MPOs are federally required throughout the country in areas with a population of 50,000 or more and are required to produce a 20+ year transportation plan, called a Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), and a four-year planning document called the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).
>
> CAMPO is governed by a 21-member Transportation Policy Board, made up of 19 elected officials and a representative from TxDOT and one from Capital Metro. The Policy Board is the body that makes decisions on CAMPO policy and decides how CAMPO funding is allocated.

Austin's 2022 population of 974,447 (2022; US Census Estimate) makes up 39% of the total population represented within CAMPO yet this 21 member board contains only 4 members from Austin which means that Austin's overall voting and decision making power is significantly lower than its population size. This leads to poor decision making that negatively impacts Austin because our needs are not adequately represented.

There doesn't yet exist a movement in Austin to fix CAMPO so that it is fairly representative or so that Austin can have its own MPO. However similar efforts have been taken up in neighboring cities like the [Fair For Houston initiative](https://www.fairforhouston.com/). A similar initiative could be done in Austin.

## Texas Transportation Commission (TTC)

The final piece to the puzzle of how transportation gets built in is the TTC. They are a small body of 5 political appointees that make 10 year plans for CAMPO and TxDOT to fund and implement.
