At a broad level vision zero incorporates:

- Safer street design
- Evidence-based policy
- Public engagement
- Targeted law enforcement

While Vision Zero is primarily policy and research much of what is actually implemented is done via the [Austin Strategic Mobility Plan](https://www.austintexas.gov/department/austin-strategic-mobility-plan).
