There are many justifications given for opposing housing. Below you'll find some common and flawed arguments and rebuttals to them. This is offered primarily for those curious about arguments they have heard against housing and who may be unaware of the evidence against each of these arguments. Anti-housing arguments are often rhetorical rather than factual, picked for their ability to persuade rather than inform. As we'll see even a mild exploration of the data around housing shows that more housing makes homes more affordable while more public transit options and choices beyond car commuting makes getting around faster, more pleasant, and more equitable.

## Costs

### Housing prices / Rent will continue to cost the same or increase

This is simply false. Empirical evidence from [Minneapolis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-08-09/minneapolis-controls-us-inflation-with-affordable-housing-renting) to [Germany](https://cityobservatory.org/building-more-housing-lowers-rents-for-everyone/) show that building more housing lowers costs both for renting and owning.

Minneapolis saw one of the largest recent decreases in both housing and inflation in general as a result of their choice to build more housing. They did this by eliminating exclusionary single family zoning and providing rental assistance and subsidies.

> In May, the Twin Cities became the first major metropolitan area to see annual inflation fall below the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Its 1.8% pace of price increases was the lowest of any region that month.
That’s largely due to a region-wide push to address one of the most intractable issues for both the Fed and American consumers: rising housing costs.

Happily Austin is not far behind, particularly among renters, as it has been encouraging the development of more apartment buildings which have overall lowered Austin rents by over 5% since last year; a reduction that far exceeds almost any other city in the US. To say nothing of US cities where rents continue to skyrocket due to restricted supply such as Madison, WI and Odessa, TX where rents [are up by 9-14% over last year](https://twitter.com/jayparsons/status/1710350167902200128)!

Similarly home ownership costs have stayed low in Minneapolis, Houston, and other cities due to more relaxed zoning. Houston for example has small minimum lot sizes and [no zoning for use](https://kinder.rice.edu/urbanedge/houston-doesnt-have-zoning-there-are-workarounds) which has resulted in their housing costs staying 17% below the national average despite being one of the largest cities in the US.

More generally this is how capitalism works. When artificial constraints are removed from markets and supply is allowed to naturally increase this brings down costs for people. It's not magic, it's not something that works the opposite of every other resource, it's subject to the same supply and demand forces.

However, not all housing affordability will or should be a result simply of market forces. In other cases we need our city to step in and ensure that the most in need have a safe, warm, and stable place to sleep every night, to engage with others, and to have friends over. All humans deserve this minimum of dignity and thankfully Austin has also implemented measures to help address this. You can read more about theses measures in the [Affordable Housing](/austin/housing/affordable_housing) section.

### Property taxes will go up

As you can see in the above topic if property values come down then so will property taxes as they're a function of property values. However we have empirical evidence directly for this as well. For example Houston's median property tax bill is $3,838 as of 2021 while Austin's during the same period was $6,517 ([Source: Taxfoundation.org; 2021](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/state/property-taxes-by-state-county-2023/) data at county-level). Effectively double the tax in large part due to restricted supply that has only started to ease in recent years.

Similarly in Connecticut towns that issued the most housing permits had their residents spending [$4,900 less in property taxes](https://ctmirror.org/2023/10/13/ct-housing-units-property-tax-rates/) than towns issuing few permits.

## Infrastructure

No infrastructure is static and a building permit issued day 1 does not create a building on day 2. There are long lead times and many departments within the City of Austin who's job it is to ensure infrastructure meets demand.

## Environmental

### Cities create heat islands

Parking, large roads, and empty spaces create heat islands. Taller buildings may reduce heat islands but need to do some research on if gentle density heights will have any impact here.

### More housing is bad for the environment

It should go without saying but people need a place to live. They will need homes regardless. So questions on environmentalism boil down to efficiency and where homes are built rather than if we should build.

### Living in pods, eating bugs, not allowed to leave our zone

Honey we just want to be able to walk to a store, a park, or let kid's play outside safely. This isn't Facebook nor the end times.
