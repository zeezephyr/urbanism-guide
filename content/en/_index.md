We are here for those who understand we are people and we do not end at the houses we live in nor the vehicles we occupy. For those who want neighbors and livable cities where going outside is pleasant, safe, healthy, and stimulating. Where people of all ages and abilities can have easy access to their local world.

> What is invariant is the aspiration to rediscover the lost human community, and this cannot take place through a reestablishment of the past, but only through new creation.

If this intrigues you then keep reading to understand what urbanism is and how you can help further its various causes to improve our lives.

We are based in Austin, Texas and as such have a good deal of material specifically about urbanism in Austin and the USA. However we aim to provide plenty of great info here no matter where in the world that you are. So keep on reading!

A good place to start is [What is Urbanism?](/getting_started/what_is_urbanism)
