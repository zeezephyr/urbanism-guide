# Welcome

This is the urbanism dot guide repository. A current work in progress that should get its first release in the next few months.

This guide is intended to be a way to get those mildly interested in any one or more urbanist issues further along in their journeys.

Unfortunately most actionable urbanist information is buried deep within hard to access government websites, chat rooms, mailing lists, and other places where you kind of already need to be into urbanism to get into it.

The goal is to use this website to eliminate that Catch-22 and educate with easily digestible, factual, and strongly informed material. Eventually turning some of our readers into active contributors to urbanist causes.

## Writing Style

The style we're going for is:

- Educational and informational
- Inspirational, not shying away from emotions
- Clear and concise
- Factual
- Strong informed opinions, not neutral
- A focus on equity and fairness
