[{"body":" AURA's endorsements Check out AURA’s endorsements for city council on Instagram. These are the candidates most equipped to create positive change in our city. The Importance of Voting Present day Texas state law makes it crucial to have a supermajority of pro-housing and pro-transportation council members on city council due to a provision known as a “valid petition” which gives property owners special rights that other Texas citizens do not have. Under this law property owners can stop rezoning of any land within 200 feet of their property provided that those petitioning own at least 20% of the land.\nRenters do not get this right, 80% of land owners cannot petition in favor of a rezoning that would build housing or improve transportation. A single large landowner can dictate what an entire neighborhood is capable of doing. The landlord of a large apartment complex gets more say over what is built nextdoor than the hundreds of people who live there.\nHowever “valid petitions” cannot overcome a three-fourths supermajority ruling by City Council. In these cases the City Council is able to override the valid petition. Within the context of Austin this means that any improvement which is legally challenged must have a 9-2 supermajority.\nThis is not academic. An anti-housing lawsuit representing just 1.4% of the city’s population very recently overturned multiple rezonings. This lawsuit would have also overturned what is arguably Austin’s best affordable housing initiative. It survived solely due to a procedural issue.\nUnlike in other states, Texas’ petition law now endangers citywide rezonings, thanks to a 2022 court opinion in City of Austin v. Acuña that blocked Austin from overhauling its own zoning (which was done to comply with its comprehensive plan, as paradoxically required under state law). In that case, a mere 1.4 percent of the city’s population was enough to force the supermajority at city council per the valid petition law. The court’s ruling jeopardizes future zoning overhauls in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals District and casts a shadow over any Texas city’s efforts to comprehensively rezone.\n– Salim Furth \u0026 C. Whit Ewen via Mercatus.org\nMore can be done to overhaul and fix Texas’ broken “valid petition” law but until that happens it is absolutely vital that anyone who cares about housing even slightly get out and vote for pro-housing candidates.\nFind Your District You can find your city council district on either Austin’s City Council page or Austin’s District Map.

Everyone cares about different aspects of urbanism be it housing, equity, public transit, bike lanes, safety, etc.\nBeing an urbanist does not require that you know and do everything. There are many of us. If we each pick and do what we’re most interested in then our cities will be better for it. Look for what speaks to you.\nFirst, Get Out In Your Neighborhood The most basic thing you can do is get out and try walking somewhere, biking, or taking transit. The organization Get There ATX has a bunch of resources for whatever forms work for you. The first step is as simple as pulling up your mapping app and seeing what is within a reasonable and safe distance of your home, work, or some place you go to a lot. One thing I’ve found is that by simply choosing to get places without a car I discover the world around me much more easily. I find small places, parks, quiet streets, and bump into friends and acquaintances who I’d never otherwise see.\nIf you happen to live further away from safe non-car forms of commuting then all is not lost either. Take your car to somewhere that is walkable and pleasant, drive to a bus stop or the Redline. Simply find a way to make your travel part of what you’re doing. Don’t just drive into the city for a one off event, make a day of it, head out early and go to a park, or hang back later and just take a walk. So often we go from our home to a parking spot next to our destination and avoid taking that even a moment to see what else is around us. We avoid stepping out of our carefully curated schedules to avoid traffic and drive to our next planned thing. Get out and wander when you can.\nWhatever you do or don’t do know that this is not some gigantic commitment. Rather this is just you seeing what many of us can do through our actions, small and big, frequent and uncommon. Getting out, seeing what’s possible, and what else can be done is not just about satisfying your need for human connection but also seeing if you care about these things. If you do then you may find that it motivates you to want more livable cities both for yourself and others.\nIf you truly can’t do these things because of schedules, affordability, or inaccessibility then know that all is not lost here either. We can still make our towns and cities better. We can make them easier to get around, affordable, and accessible. There are many resources for doing so in small to large ways; so check them out below.\nSecond, Get Involved Urbanists make their voice heard. It may sound simple or cheesy but this is what anti-urbanists do and it’s why our neighborhoods are put together so poorly and unfairly. We are going to change this.\nWe do this in a variety of ways that vary from low effort to high effort. Start where you want but we suggest starting with simple, low effort actions to dip your toes, familiarize yourself, and build from there. All of these efforts can and do have a high impact on how our cities and towns evolve.\nSome examples of urbanist activites in rough order of effort are:\nAnswering surveys\nContacting representatives\nGetting outside\nEducating yourself, friends, and family\nAttending city council meetings\nCanvassing / door knocking, \u0026 phone banking\nAttending demonstrations and protests\nContent creation\nResearch\nEvent planning\nOrganizing\nThere are many places to get informed on Austin urbanism and find many things to do within both urbanist and urbanist-aligned causes.

Below you’ll find some common and flawed arguments and rebuttals to them. This is offered primarily for those curious about arguments they have heard against housing and who may be unaware of the evidence against each of these arguments. Anti-housing arguments are often rhetorical rather than factual, picked for their ability to persuade rather than inform. As we’ll see even a mild exploration of the data around housing shows that more housing makes homes more affordable while more public transit options and choices beyond car commuting makes getting around faster, more pleasant, and more equitable.\nEconomic Housing prices / Rent will continue to cost the same or increase This is simply false. Empirical evidence from Minneapolis to Germany show that building more housing lowers costs both for renting and owning.\nMinneapolis saw one of the largest recent decreases in both housing and inflation in general as a result of their choice to build more housing. They did this by eliminating exclusionary single family zoning and providing rental assistance and subsidies.\nIn May, the Twin Cities became the first major metropolitan area to see annual inflation fall below the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Its 1.8% pace of price increases was the lowest of any region that month. That’s largely due to a region-wide push to address one of the most intractable issues for both the Fed and American consumers: rising housing costs.\nSource: Bloomberg “First American City to Tame Inflation Owes Its Success to Affordable Housing” / archive.ph mirror\nSource: FT.com “Repeat after me: building any new homes reduces housing costs for all” / archive.ph mirror\nHappily Austin is not far behind, particularly among renters, as it has been encouraging the development of more apartment buildings which have overall lowered Austin rents by over 5% since last year; a reduction that far exceeds almost any other city in the US. To say nothing of US cities where rents continue to skyrocket due to restricted supply such as Madison, WI and Odessa, TX where rents are up by 9-14% over last year!\nSource: Twitter (@jayparsons)\nSimilarly home ownership costs have stayed low in Minneapolis, Houston, and other cities due to more relaxed zoning. Houston for example has small minimum lot sizes and no zoning for use which has resulted in their housing costs staying 17% below the national average despite being one of the largest cities in the US.\nSource: Houston.org “Housing cost comparison”\nMore generally this is how capitalism works. When artificial constraints are removed from markets and supply is allowed to naturally increase this brings down costs for people. It’s not magic, it’s not something that works the opposite of every other resource, it’s subject to the same supply and demand forces.\nHowever, not all housing affordability will or should be a result simply of market forces. In other cases we need our city to step in and ensure that the most in need have a safe, warm, and stable place to sleep every night, to engage with others, and to have friends over. All humans deserve this minimum of dignity and thankfully Austin has also implemented measures to help address this. You can read more about theses measures in the Affordable Housing section.\nProperty taxes will go up As you can see in the above topic if property values come down then so will property taxes as they’re a function of property values. However we have empirical evidence directly for this as well. For example Houston’s median property tax bill is $3,838 as of 2021 while Austin’s during the same period was $6,517 (Source: Taxfoundation.org; 2021 data at county-level). Effectively double the tax in large part due to restricted supply that has only started to ease in recent years.\nSimilarly in Connecticut towns that issued the most housing permits had their residents spending $4,900 less in property taxes than towns issuing few permits.\nCities cost too much Dense city centers create wealth in a city while car-centric suburbia destroys it.\nThis section/topic is incomplete. If you have some knowledge on this subject please help out by editing this page.\nInfrastructure No infrastructure is static and a building permit issued day 1 does not create a building on day 2. There are long lead times and many departments within the City of Austin who’s job it is to ensure infrastructure meets demand.\nThe roads can’t handle it This is correct but in the wrong way. Car-centric roads have never and will never handle capacity as well as every other mode of transportation does. The answer to the question of what to do about road capacity is not to limit housing, encourage sprawl, and further environmental destruction through car dependence. The answer is to provide better more convenient modes of transit, to build people’s basic necessities close to where they live, and to stop spending so much of our lives literally dying in traffic.\nCar dependence has resulted in yearly costs of:\n$26,000 of costs per household 40,000 deaths on US roads. 40,000 funerals. Countless devastated family members and friends 4,000,000,000 pounds of microplastics The solution then is to build infrastructure for public transit, biking, and walking. Check those articles to learn more.\nDid you know? 50% of all trips made in the US are 3 miles or less. These are easily reachable for most people with an e-bike or manual bike provided the infrastructure is available. Learn more. The water supply can’t handle it Austin, like most every major city in the US, has a water department that produces plans to address water needs well into the city’s future and provides annual progress reports. Austin Water itself has a 100-year plan termed “Water Forward” that the department is using to ensure the city has enough water.\nMore specifically within Austin when it comes to concerns about water supply we see:\nMulti-family homes are much more water efficient than single family homes A large reduction in the number of gallons of water pumped per capita per day since 2008 Water bills continuing to trend down relative to Austin’s Median Household Income On the first point, single family homes contribute to water waste while multi-family homes are more efficient per capita. According to the US Census and data from Austin Water (2019-2020), single family homes use roughly 20% more water per capita than Multi-family homes. Single family homes are simply less efficient with our water resources than multi-family homes. The chart below shows that both single and multi-family homes each made up about half of the population Austin, yet there are large differences in their water consumption.\nSources: US Census 2019 Estimates, and Austin Water “Residential Water Consumption” data set (Most recently available 12 month period: 2019-2020)\nAccording to the EPA Outdoor water use accounts for 30 percent of household use yet can be much higher in drier parts of the country and in more water-intensive landscapes The largest waste of water with single family homes is watering lawns full of bermuda grass and other non-native species that needs copious amounts of water to survive Texas summers. This is why we get notices to reduce lawn watering when Texas enters drought periods.\nSource: Austin Water “Drought Response”\nSo while people may make unfounded claims that our water crisis will get worse with more density, we actually see that the opposite is true:\nThat denser housing is much more efficient, while sprawl is more wasteful The solution to water concerns is not to ban housing but to restrict wasteful usage of our natural resources Austin Water “2022 Annual Progress Report”\nThe electric grid can’t handle it This section/topic is incomplete.

If you have some knowledge on this subject please help out by editing this page.\nParking, large roads, and empty spaces create heat islands.\nCutting down a tree to build housing is environmental destruction This depends on where you cut down the tree(s). In practical, relative terms, removing a handful of trees on private property in order to build housing within a city will always be significantly lower impact than clearcutting huge acres of trees to build more suburbia and highways. Places immediately outside the City of Austin have seen substantial tree cover loss as our surrounding hillside and forests are cut down in order to make way for sprawl. Along with fires, storm damage, and other contributors to tree cover loss; many of which have direct and indirect causes related to urban sprawl and human activity.\nBelow is the total tree cover loss since 2000 in Travis and surrounding counties that make up the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Notably almost all of this loss is outside the City of Austin.\nCounty Tree Cover Loss (kha) Tree Cover Loss (square miles) Travis 8.2 31.7 Williamson 6.37 24.59 Bastrop 14.2 54.83 Caldwell 2.83 10.93 Hays 7.11 27.45 Total 38.71 149.5 Source: Global Forest Watch. “Tree cover loss in Travis, Williamson, Bastrop, Caldwell, and Hays counties”. Accessed on 17/12/2023 from www.globalforestwatch.org\nWhile it is difficult to quantify the exact contribution of further suburban development and the repeated encroachment of our built environments on nature, it is apparent from the images below that clear cutting for suburbia has lead to substantial loss of tree cover.\nA large overview of forest loss since 2000.

Source: Hansen/UMD/Google/USGS/NASA\nThis is not to say that trees aren’t important in cities. Trees are a vital component in any livable, walkable, and equitable city. Fortunately the City of Austin recognizes this and has a plan to increase the city’s tree canopy. Thus far tree canopy has increased from 30% in 2005 to 41% in 2022. Austin is gaining tree canopy; not losing it. Further the City of Austin has recognized that there is significant disparity in tree canopy between West and East Austin. Austin’s Community Tree Priority Map was created to address this inequity.\nTree canopy gains The City of Austin has been gaining tree canopy since 2005. It’s now up to 41% and CoA will keep adding to it! Dense housing is bad for the environment It should go without saying but people need a place to live. They will need homes regardless. So questions on environmentalism boil down to efficiency and where and how homes are built rather than if we should build. There is no option where we do not provide enough housing for people who need it.\nSo we have two overarching options: encourage urban sprawl, or encourage urban infill. In sprawl, as we practice today, our land development codes push where people live further and further out from work, school, recreation, family, and friends. Encouraging urban infill does the opposite, bringing the physical location of these things closer.\nThe data is clear that urban infill is better for the environment than sprawl. In 2018, researchers at California, Berkeley analyzed 700 cities and found that the single biggest impact that local governments can have on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is to increase urban infill (ie. housing in urbanized spaces). Mind you we are not talking about turning every city into the center of Manhattan. Simply locating housing closer to people’s needs and daily activities can have a massive impact.\nFurthermore this study shows that urban infill in general is one of the biggest levers that local governments have in addressing climate change. Except for heating electrification all other local policies have little to moderate impact and depend on state and federal intervention alongside local government action. But not housing. Housing is the big lever for local governments. Austin is only getting hotter.\nSource: University of California, Berkeley\nThis section/topic is incomplete.

Parking mandates are historically based on little data leading to absurdly large parking lots and excessive residential parking. There’s an estimated 700,000,000 to 2,000,000,000 parking spaces across the US. It’s so large that nobody actually knows the true number. You can read more about them on our parking mandates page.\nHome Options for Middle-Income Empowerment (December 7th) HOME Phase 1 passed with a supermajority vote of 9-2. The bill had broad based support from Austin Habitat for Humanity, AARP Texas, Housing Works Austin, Preservation Austin, Austin EMS Association, and many other organizations.\nThe new law will allow up to 3 homes to be built on a single family lot. This measure removes artificial supply restrictions from Austin’s 1984 land development code that have played a significant part in making housing unaffordable. Importantly it also comes with amendments that strongly encourage preservation of existing structures that will help prevent displacement:\nThe Preservation Bonus which provides incentives to encourage the preservation of 100% of a pre-1960 home’s facade and 50% or more of its structure. The Sustainability Bonus which provides incentives to preserve 50% or more of a post-1960s home’s materials. You can learn more about HOME here and on atxhomecoalition.com. If you want to learn about the details of the preservation and sustainability bonus then check out Preservation Austin’s announcement of support for HOME.\nFor Phase 2 of HOME, which will be taken up by City Council this spring, Preservation Austin will advocate for new people-centered policies, especially for East Austin’s Black and Brown communities, to level the playing field between homeowners and developers and prevent further displacement. In 2023, Preservation Austin and the City of Austin’s Displacement Prevention Division released a report on how preserving historic-age housing can support affordability goals, prevent displacement, and preserve culture. Findings recommended that the city expand existing home repair and community land trust programs, and that it develop new tools like the Preservation Bonus to help homeowners monetize their property through the construction of ADUs.\n– Lindsey Derrington, Executive Director, Preservation Austin\nGet Involved with Advocates While we’ve made great progress there’s still much to do for HOME Phase 2 which will be heard by city council in early 2024. There’s never been a better time to get involved and take action. Try joining the AURA Discord, signing up for AURA’s newsletter, or volunteering at Preservation Austin. Easier to Open a Daycare Center (October 19th) Child care centers can now open in more convenient locations within the City of Austin. Previously child care centers needed to be in certain areas which limited the amount of child care centers in Austin and required parents to travel long distances just to drop off and pick up their children. The removal of these restrictions are intended to make child care more accessible to working class families and more convenient for everyone.\nThe zoning process can be time consuming and expensive. Additionally, because zoning allowed day cares only in certain areas, there was a lack of them in others. There were 31 ZIP codes in Austin designated as child care deserts, Fuentes said.\n“If we’re really serious about addressing affordability we have to make child care more affordable, and we have to make it more convenient for families all across our city,” she said.\n– Council Member Vanessa Fuentes via KXAN\nATX Walk Bike Roll (November 30th) Austin updated and expanded their extensive plans to build more bike lanes, side walks, urban trails, and other multi-modal transportation options for those who can’t or don’t want to drive. Biking is already a very enjoyable, and environmentally sustainable option with very low infrastructure impact so it’s great to see the city expanding options for commuting and recreation. We’ve got a page on biking too, lots of tips in there if you’re interested in taking advantage of this new infrastructure.\nAustin’s Metro Bikes are Expanding and Going Fully Electric (October 26th) Austin recently received a $11.3M federal grant that will allow the city to expand the size of its fleet while going fully electric. This may sound like a luxury but e-bikes enable more people to bike and to travel further by bike than they could have before. Letting more people reach more public transportation, jobs, and educational opportunities. Plus it’s a great way to get out more, enjoy the weather, and see friends. If you’ve never tried an e-bike before then maybe hop on a MetroBike or stop by an e-bike store for a test ride. Did you know the City of Austin will give you a rebate on an e-bike? There’s even better rebates for those on Austin Energy’s Customer Assistance Program.\nSince its launch, MetroBike has proven to be an extremely popular mode of transportation in Austin, especially among university students. MetroBike usage has steadily grown since 2019, from less than 5,000 to 12,000 trips per month during the pandemic. As the City added ebikes to the fleet, it has reached nearly 28,000 monthly trips as of April 2023. The service also peaks in popularity during major events, reaching 34,000 in the 2021 ACL Festival; 37,000 during 2022 South by Southwest; and 43,000 at the 2022 ACL Festival.\n– City of Austin\nBarton Springs Road Safety Pilot (Late August) A pedestrian heavy section of Barton Springs Road received a road safety pilot in late August with the goal of reducing vehicle speeding, adding bike lanes, and overall making the road safer and more pleasant for this busy area. The diet is in a 1-year trial phase but already showing significant increases in safety with no real impact to travel times. This change was made in response to a severe crash that severely injured 10 people on Barton Springs Road in April 2022. You can read the full BSR Road Safety Pilot’s Frequently Asked Questions here.\n“And for five of those six periods on eastbound and westbound, we’ve seen a reduction in travel times. It’s more efficient to get through in the single lane, with the one exception being westbound, there’s about 10 seconds of extra delay in the morning. So what we’ve seen is really significant safety results that we were trying to achieve with minimal impacts of travel time through the corridor,”\n– Lewis Leff via KXAN\nCapital-A Affordable Housing Expanding More affordable housing is being built thanks to a combination of city policy and the activism of those dedicated to housing those most in need. Some notable projects we’re aware of are:\nMary Lee Square is expanding from 240 units to 500 units. Along with many more 2 and 3 bedroom units for families which are rare to see in affordable housing. These units will be for people earning at or below 60% Median Family Income (MFI). 60% MFI is roughly $52,980 for a family of 2, and $66,180 for a family of 4 as of 2022. Austin Housing Finance Corporation and Austin Housing Conservancy are partnering to fund and build 234 affordable housing units near transit. These units will serve those making between 50% and 80% MFI. You can view the full breakdown of MFI limits here. This effort is a part of Austin’s Strategic Blueprint for addressing housing affordability, displacement, and homelessness. City of Austin has started the process of redeveloping Hobby Building for workforce housing. Get Involved with Housing Several organizations are responsible for this much needed housing. You can learn about them and get involved at: Foundation Communities, The Mary Lee Foundation, and Austin Housing Conservancy. Austin Rents Down Due to Apartments Being Built While the rental market is complex it’s hard to deny that building more housing reduces rent costs. Like really hard to deny. Study after study says so but more work must be done.\nSuch is the case in Austin where large increases to the amount of apartment buildings has caused rents to drop -5.6% YoY which you can read more about on our NIMBY rebuttals page.\nWhen a bunch of tech firms open up headquarters in Austin and create lots of high-paying jobs there, more high-skill workers will move into the city to take those jobs. Those workers will demand housing, and developers will respond by increasing construction.\nBut you can’t stop the yuppies from coming by blocking that construction. So long as high-paying jobs are being created in your city, high-income workers are going to move there. If there is no new “luxury” housing to absorb them, they will simply outbid less affluent residents for the housing units that already exist. Thus the less new housing that gets built, the faster rents will rise in a booming city.\n– Eric Levitz, Intelligencer\nIt’s Now Easier to Open Music Venues (September 14th) Live music is truly part of the soul of Austin and one of the things that makes this city both great and unique. The new ordinance now makes it easier to open music venues outside of downtown without your venue needing to also be a bar or a nightclub. Despite the city’s rich musical history you needed to previously get licensed as a bar in order to have live music. Now that is no more and music venues are treated as valid forms of entertainment and recreation in their own right.\n$22.9M in Funding for Safer Streets (September 14th) Austin’s Safe Streets for All program is going to see a big boost in funding thanks to a federal grant from the US Department of Transportation. According to the City of Austin it will provide for “safety improvements at more than 60 locations throughout the city”.\nThursday’s Council action sets in motion plans to implement safety improvements at more than 60 locations throughout the city, with specific project locations to be chosen after further analysis is completed. Austin’s SS4A grant will fund:\nmajor intersection safety projects at 5-7 locations up to 10 pedestrian hybrid beacons low-cost, systemic safety treatments such as high-visibility crosswalk markings, street lighting, and traffic signal improvements at dozens of locations throughout the city a safety education campaign primarily focused on roundabouts and video analytics for safety analysis and evaluation – City of Austin\nTexas Achievements Crash Not Accident Passes (June 12th) A multi-year long effort to get all references to car “accidents” in Texas law to be changed to “crashes” has passed. This may seem small but it is a necessary step in acknowledging the great harm that car crashes cause citizens of Texas. Many of these crashes are preventable with better road design, driver responsibility, and alternatives to commuting by car. Calling them “accidents” minimizes the true harm and cost of car crashes.\nIn 2017 1,617,597 people were involved in vehicle crashes in the Texas transportation system, killing almost 3,800 of them and severely injuring 17,956 of them. About 1,700 times a day people are involved in a crash somewhere in Texas – on average every 51 seconds. An average day in the Texas transportation system takes ten lives and leaves 50 people with life-changing serious injuries like brain damage or loss of a limb.\n– Scott White, Farm \u0026 City\nJaywalking Partially Decriminalized (June 13th) Believe it or not prior to September 1, 2023 if you weren’t in a car, and the street you were walking down didn’t have sidewalks, you could be stopped and fined for jaywalking. HB1277 half corrects this by requiring someone walking in a road without sidewalks to be walking on the left side of the street.\nStatewide Lot Size and Compatibility Reforms Get Close to Victory Bills reducing the minimum lot size needed to build a home, compatibility restrictions on height, and legalizing “granny flats” (aka ADUs) got extremely close to passing. They ultimately didn’t pass this time but how close we got only underlines the importance of getting involved so that next session we can get much needed housing reform passed and get more homes built for the people who need them.\nProponents of building more homes pushed legislation that would loosen city housing regulations and enlisted many Republicans in the GOP-dominated Legislature to help push the proposals over the line.\nBut those bills hit a wall this week amid opposition from both parties and neighborhood groups that work passionately to kill any attempt to build new housing in their areas. Democrats also cited concerns that the bills would further infringe on cities’ and counties’ ability to make their own rules on housing.\n“There are many lessons Texas can learn from expensive states like California of what happens when you don’t build housing to accommodate job growth and family growth, before it’s too late for Texas’ middle class,” said Nicole Nosek, head of Texans for Reasonable Solutions, a nonprofit that pushed the housing bills this session.\n– Joshua Fechter, The Texas Tribune\n","categories":"","description":"In 2023 urbanists, activists, city council, and staff succeeded in legalizing townhouses, removing poorly defined parking mandates, expanding affordable and workforce housing, improving multi-modal transportation access, making it easier to open a day care, and much more all with the goal of making Austin more livable for all!\n","excerpt":"In 2023 urbanists, activists, city council, and staff succeeded in …","ref":"/austin/wins/2023/","tags":"","title":"2023"},{"body":"Affordable housing is a term that has many meanings depending on who you’re talking to and what you’re talking about. Most generally affordable housing can be broken down into two major categories:\nCapital-A Affordability for people living within a certain household income level as defined by the City of Austin Market-rate affordability (ie. the present day cost of housing) Both of these are entirely legitimate concerns and ways to think about housing, so we’ll discuss them both and some of the ways in which affordability has been and can continue to be addressed. However it’s important to keep in mind that housing affordability is one large piece of a big puzzle that includes cost of transit, utilities, and services. It is also not the end-all be-all of all housing solutions. For example this article doesn’t address the needs of permanent supportive housing. These and other concerns are addressed through other policy and efforts.\nFind Affordable Housing If you’re in need of affordable housing the City of Austin has a search tool for finding Affordable housing. There are also numerous other resources for landlord issues, evictions, rent and utility assistance, and more. City of Austin Housing Affordability Initiatives Housing security is one of several important safety nets that are crucial to a healthy and functioning society. Towards this end cities often implement policies to help ensure people remain with housing and without undue hardship. Austin itself has had about a dozen different initiatives with varying rates of success.\nSome of the most impactful initiatives in terms of units built have been:\nAffordability Unlocked Vertical Mixed Use Zoning Planned Unit Development Median Family Income The income levels mentioned below are based on Median Family Income (MFI). MFI is a measure of what the average household earns in the Austin-Round Rock area. The 100% MFI in 2023 was $97,850 for a family of 2 meaning half of all families earned less than this, and half earned more. This could be one family member earning $97,850, or 2 each earning $48,925, or any other split. There are MFI levels for all household sizes and incomes. Common ones are 80% and 60% MFI which would be $74,800 and $56,100 respectively. Affordability Unlocked (AU) Affordability unlocked is a program created by the City of Austin in 2019 (original text, AU guide) to address housing affordability without subsidizing the housing with taxes. The plan achieves this by allowing developers who apply for Affordability Unlocked to build housing that is up to 25-50% taller than the current zoning limitations. This program is most commonly used in tandem with Multi-family zoning and VMU combining zoning districts along transit corridors where residents would have close and convenient access to public transit.\nIn practical terms this means that buildings using Affordability unlocked are able to build rentable and ownable housing for those living at or under 80% of the Median Family Income (MFI) of Austin’s citizens. Affordability Unlocked is further divided into two types, aptly called Type 1, and Type 2.\nUnder Type 1 at least half of all units built must be affordable. For rentals they must be kept affordable for a minimum of 40 years for those earning between 20% ($18,700) to 50% MFI ($46,750). For ownable units they must be kept affordable for a minimum of 99 years for those earning incomes averaging up to 80% MFI ($74,800).\nUnder Type 2 at least three quarters of all units must be affordable and meet all Type 1 requirements. In addition they must locate the building within a quarter-mile of a transit corridor and designate at least 10% of affordable housing for those earning under 30% MFI ($28,050).\nAs of 2023 over 480 units of housing have been built, 2800 are under construction, and a further 2,800 units are in the planning stages. Incredibly 80% of all planned and built housing units under this plan meet the affordability requirements of AU, exceeding the minimums set in place by the program itself.\nVertical Mixed Use Zoning (VMU1 \u0026 VMU2) Vertical Mixed Use zoning is a provision applied along major existing and future transit corridors with the goal of getting more of Austin’s citizens close to transit with mixed-use development that provides both housing and retail development. This zoning addresses affordability in multiple ways:\nAllowing for more units of housing to be built along these corridors Placing homes closer to current and future affordable transit options Creating easier access to the daily conveniences people need The original VMU zoning (VMU1) was introduced in 2010 and allowed for reducing setbacks, mixed use development (residential and commercial), reduced parking minimums, and increased building heights; typically up to 60 feet. Along with this VMU1 set out small allowances of 10% affordable housing for rental and ownership developments.\nVMU1 has thus far succeeded in creating over 100 new buildings under this zoning and as such was expanded with VMU2 that allows for buildings zoned for high density multifamily residences (MF-6) to reach 90 feet in height by right (ie. by default); along with a 12% affordable housing minimum.\nBoth VMU1 and VMU2 can be kept lower in height due to compatibility restrictions.\nVMU overturned Unfortunately a lawsuit by anti-housing advocates overturned VMU2 on notification grounds. However this story is not over and continued pro-housing advocacy will bring about better and stronger initiatives. Maybe get involved and help us make Austin better! Planned Unit Development This section/topic is incomplete. If you have some knowledge on this subject please help out by editing this page.\nHousing Affordability in General Housing affordability in general requires a multi-pronged approach so that housing prices can be brought down to a point where they are affordable to those living above the income levels defined by CoA. It’s not hard to see how even those earning at and above Austin’s median income are struggling to afford housing. Housing affordability across the US has dropped steeply and this is driven by many factors including:\nLand use policies Interest rates on loans Unrealistic lot size minimums Parking mandates Tax structures which disincentivize building housing Compatibility restrictions Deed restrictions “Valid Petition” laws Land Use Policies HOME Phase 1 Passes! HOME Phase 1 passed city council by a supermajority 9-2 vote on December 7th, 2023. HOME Phase 2 will likely be considered early next year. It’s never been a better time to get involved! One of the key hindrances to housing affordability is the availability of housing. Within Austin, and most US cities, supply has been artificially restricted for at least a century. Today Austin has a housing code (aka Land Development Code; LDC) that was last updated in the 1980s along with very large lot size minimums that were last updated in the 1940s; the history of which we cover in our article on euclidean zoning restrictions.\nAustin City Council is addressing these overly restrictive and exclusionary zoning restrictions with an initiative called HOME. This initiative is designed to revamp our outdated land development code by allowing more housing to be built within the core of Austin. Housing that used to exist here but was made illegal in 1984.\nHOME is planned in two phases that collectively allow for the building of more housing and better neighborhoods by:\nReducing residential minimum lot sizes from 5,750 sq ft to 2,500 sq ft. Allowing up to 3 units of housing to be built on a lot without additional zoning changes to the lot Making various other adjustments to the LDC that you can read about on atxhomecoalition.com HOME will allow more neighborhoods to follow the design principles of livable, walkable, nice areas. Transforming what is currently a limited luxury for the well off of our city into something that everyone who lives in Austin can enjoy. This doesn’t mean all of our neighborhoods will end up looking like any specific place, just that we’ll have more flexibility in what we build, who we build it for, and what it costs.\nMinimum Lot Size Austin’s minimum lot size will still remain quite big relative to nearby cities. Houston for example has a minimum lot size of 1,400 sq ft! Interest rates on loans Much like with the student loan crisis the housing affordability crisis is affected by the availability of loans and low interest rates. However this is a very complex topic and outside the scope of a guide to urbanism as it is not something urbanism can solve directly. Within the context of housing urbanism is principally concerned with the supply side of the housing market (ie. the total amount of homes available for people to live in) while interest rates primarily influence the demand side of the housing market (ie. money people have to purchase property).\nOf course no understanding of the situation we are in is complete without some understanding of the effect interest rates have on housing costs so here’s a few resources if you’re interested. Just know that this subject is tangential to urbanism rather than central. Urbanism doesn’t need to address interest rates to fix the housing crisis.\nHow Interest Rates Affect Property Values How Higher Mortgage Rates Have Historically Affected Home Prices Can Home Prices and Interest Rates Soar at the Same Time? Unrealistic lot size minimums Austin, like most US cities, has an overwhelming amount of its residential living space zoned exclusively for single family free standing homes on large lots. Within Austin the minimum lot size you can currently build a single family home on is 5,750 square feet and within that lot you can only build a house and other impervious ground cover on 40% of it. 60% of your lot must be left as unused space. This is leading to various crises in the housing market ranging from entire generations of young people being priced out of affordable housing to older generations living alone in large homes and unable to find smaller homes to downsize to.\nTax structures favoring empty lots This section/topic is incomplete.

With every bike lane added, with every person out riding bikes, drivers and people in general become more familiar with, aware of, and supportive of biking as a form of commute.\nBiking is not just healthy but also offers many other benefits:\nIt’s much cheaper than driving. Even an e-bike uses just 5-10 cents of electricity per charge and a typical e-bike has a range of 30-60 miles. It’s significantly less strain on infrastructure. Bikes cause almost zero damage to roads. Larger, heavier vehicles are responsible for road damage. Biking is generally a much more pleasant experience than driving. You feel a lot more present, more attached to the world around you, people wave and smile, and you simply move around at more human and lower stress speeds. Getting Around Biking in Austin is becoming more and more accessible with over 230 miles already built. With every bike lane we add we get more and more people out enjoying a simply more pleasant way of commuting.\nIt’s also important to note that not every commute is fit for biking and keeping your safety and comfort in mind is always the most important thing. Manual biking is most suitable to trips of 3 miles or less which make up over half of all trips!\nMore distance E-bikes can extend your biking range considerably, and 80% of trips are 10 miles or less!

Austin’s current compatibility restrictions are such that:\nA building within 50 feet of a SFH’s lot cannot be more than 40 feet tall. A building within 300 feet of a SFH’s lot cannot be more than 60 feet tall. Source: Findings and Recommendations for Implementing Ordinance No. 20221201-056 Regarding Compatibility Regulations, Sept 5 2023\nEffectively this means that tens of thousands of homes are currently illegal to build in Austin even in areas that are zoned for slightly denser housing. If you’ve ever noticed buildings within Austin that look like steps, getting progressively taller/shorter, this is compatibility. An artificial, and inequitable restriction on the amount of housing that can be built.\nAustin compatibility is also atypically extreme compared to most other cities. As shown in this chart where Austin has decided that the presence of a single family home can affect housing that is being built 2 blocks away.\nSource: Findings and Recommendations for Implementing Ordinance No. 20221201-056 Regarding Compatibility Regulations, Sept 5 2023\nEffects of Compatibility The failure of compatibility does not stop at simply housing. It also has effects on transportation, equity, the environment, and car dependency.\nA recent study by the City of Austin on Compatibility Regulations (September, 2023) found that 135,000 housing units are lost in areas already zoned for high density due to compatibility rules. 110,000 of the lost units (82%) are within 1/4th of a mile of an existing transit stop.\nCompatibility triggers even when no homes exist on a lot. It requires that if an area is zoned for single family housing then that is enough to restrict what can be built by it. In this way almost completely empty pieces of land, such as the one pictured below, limit what housing can be built around it.\nThe less dense we can build in places intended for density the less efficient we can make public transit. The less practical we make walking and biking the more we force people into their cars and onto highways to live out their basic needs. The more we inhibit progress on making it possible to live in an environmentally friendly way the worse off we will be. The minor and petty sensibilities of someone who doesn’t like slightly taller buildings should not even be a consideration and yet it is currently central to controlling how Austinites are allowed to live.\n","categories":"","description":"Compatibility is a way for owners of single family homes to control what others do with their homes and neighborhood.

Contributions like theirs make this site possible. If you’d like to contribute then check out the README on the urbanism.guide Github to find out how. What’s Happening? Austin City Council is proposing three measures to improve access to housing in Austin by creating more housing; particularly near transit.\nEquitable Transit Oriented Development (ETOD) Overlay: Phase 1 Equitable transit-oriented development (ETOD) works to ensure that people of all incomes experience the benefits of dense, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented development near train and bus stops.\n– CNT.org\nThe proposed ETOD overlay aims to zone for dense, mixed-use, walkable development within a half mile of the future Project Connect light rail line, while providing incentives to build more affordable housing (12-15% affordable) and protect existing affordable housing and businesses. This new zoning also seeks to discourage car-oriented development in the ETOD area (e.g. gas stations, car washes). Any new building constructed as a result of this proposal can only be done so on land that is already zoned for multifamily or commercial use. It does not affect single-family zoned properties.\nUnder our current land use policies few Austinites can walk or bike to transit. This limited accessibility then leads to less ridership, less transit funding, and worsened service. Transit struggles in low density, car-dependent environments. ETOD turns that vicious cycle into a virtuous cycle where people of all incomes, ages, and backgrounds are able to live near transit; and in this immediate case near the coming light rail of Project Connect.\nThe more people living near these new stations, the more people that can conveniently use it in their daily lives. This creates a feedback loop of increasing ridership, funding, and public support for future transit expansion. It also means reduced traffic in the areas along the light rail, reduced environmental pollution, and fewer traffic injuries and deaths. Such zoning changes would also help the city obtain federal grants for Project Connect, thereby ensuring its success.\nValid petition ETOD and other inclusive housing policies have difficulties overcoming a provision of state law known as a “valid petition” which gives unjust power to land owners to prevent housing. For this reason city policies often avoid changing zoning for single-family homes. But this is a battle we can also win. You can learn more about this on the 2024 voting guide. Removing “Compatibility” Restrictions In addition to ETOD, there is a proposal for changing the “compatibility” rules in the city. This restriction limits the height of buildings near single-family homes. “Near” in this case is not actually a small distance. To be specific, a 60 foot tall apartment building has to be at least 300 feet away from every 35 foot tall single-family home in Austin. Today compatibility affects housing out to 540 feet, or 1.5 football fields.\nThese rules imply that those who live in multifamily homes are incompatible with those who live in single-family homes. They are based on old, prejudiced, and discriminatory attitudes that say those living in apartments and condos are not welcome near the majority of the city of Austin. Austin is predominantly single-family homes.\nIn order to change this, city staff is proposing that those height limits only apply within a 75 foot distance from a single-family home. City staff estimates that 63,000 more homes could be built as a result of these policy improvements.\nCurrent vs. Proposed compatibility restrictions. Source: City of Austin via publicinput.com\nMissing housing According to one study we’re missing out on between 72,000 to 135,000 homes that could be built if “compatibility” didn’t exist. It’s not hard to see how these restrictions also limit ETOD development and in doing so restricts publicly funded transit to those lucky or wealthy enough to live in single-family homes. HOME Phase 2 Housing segregation Lot sizes increases were one of many methods used to segregate many neighborhoods throughout Austin. HOME Phase 1 was a very large victory that now allows up to 3 homes to be built on a single lot. Creating more housing for more people.\nThe HOME Phase 2 proposal is a follow-up which would lower the minimum lot size for single-family homes to a minimum of 2,000 square feet. These much more appropriately sized lots would be able to build one house each. This creates more flexibility when creating new housing. Existing residents would be able to sell parts of their large lots and create housing without affecting their current home. While new home buyers would be able to own their home outright and not have to split their ownership and control over their property with an HOA.\nHelp Get These Initiatives Passed!

TTC is a state-wide body of 5 political appointees that plans and authorizes 10 year transportation plans (aka UTPs) at a state level. These plans then get passed to TxDOT who must work with CAMPO to identify projects, funding, and finally approve plans that achieve the goals of the UTP. CAMPO approves federal funding for TxDOT highway projects. Collectively they represent a destructive, unrepresentative, and undemocratic force of will of the oil and gas industry to carve up our cities and environment for profit.\nPreface: The Cost of Highways and Roads The true cost of highways and roads is almost never discussed when it comes to budgeting within the US. The necessity of an ever larger amount of road and all their economic, social, and environmental costs are simply taken as-is.\nOn the economic side of the equation roads cost the average household $14,000 per year regardless of if they own a car or not. When factoring in car ownership the cost nearly doubles to $26,000 per household per year on average for the total cost of using roads. We need to ask the question of whether or not we should be paying such astronomical costs for the car economy when more affordable, cleaner, and safer alternatives exist.\nOn the environmental side, beyond burning fossil fuels, car tires are the second largest source of primary microplastics in our environment producing 3,962,765,390 pounds (1,797,480 tonnes) of microplastic pollution per year. The US is also the single largest per capita creator of tire-based microplastics due to how much we drive.\nTexas Transportation Commission (TTC) The first step of getting transportation built in Texas is the Texas Transportation Commission. They are a small body of 5 members appointed by the Governor of Texas. The TTC makes 10 year plans for CAMPO and TxDOT to fund and implement. According to a KXAN investigation the current appointees have “little or no prior experience”.\nAll five members of a commission tasked with overseeing the Texas Department of Transportation — and by extension, its troubled TxTag toll system — appear to have little or no prior experience with transportation but collectively donated nearly $1.5 million to Gov. Greg Abbott, who appointed them, a KXAN investigation found.\n– Matt Grant, Dalton Huey (via KXAN; May 11 2023)\nBy the current Chairman’s own admission he knew nothing about highways other than being stuck in traffic.\nCapital Area Metropolitan Planning Authority (CAMPO) CAMPO handles TTC’s plans for the 6 counties it’s responsible for, secures federal funding for highway projects, and works with TxDOT to implement plans. There are MPOs throughout Texas and the US that function similarly.\nThe Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization is the metropolitan planning organization for Bastrop, Burnet, Caldwell, Hays, Travis, and Williamson Counties. MPOs are federally required throughout the country in areas with a population of 50,000 or more and are required to produce a 20+ year transportation plan, called a Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), and a four-year planning document called the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).\nCAMPO is governed by a 21-member Transportation Policy Board, made up of 19 elected officials and a representative from TxDOT and one from Capital Metro. The Policy Board is the body that makes decisions on CAMPO policy and decides how CAMPO funding is allocated.\n– Campotexas.org\nCAMPO Representation Austin’s 2022 population of 974,447 (2022; US Census Estimate) makes up 39% of the total population represented within CAMPO yet this 21 member board contains only 4 members from Austin which means that Austin’s overall voting and decision making power is significantly lower than its population size. This leads to poor decision making that negatively impacts Austin because our needs are not adequately represented.\nFurther reducing Austin’s influence and proper representation within CAMPO is the Transportation Policy Board Executive Committee. This 9 member board is the body that makes recommendations to the full TPB board about plans, projects, and issues. Not a single member of this committee is from Austin.\nThere doesn’t yet exist a movement in Austin to fix CAMPO so that it is fairly representative or so that Austin can have its own MPO. However similar efforts have been taken up in neighboring cities like the Fair For Houston initiative which passed with 65% voter approval in November 2023. A similar initiative could be done in Austin.\nIn addition to CAMPO’s lack of proper representation for Austin it also actively excludes members of the public by:\nLocating their meetings at the Junior League on Texas 360 Loop which excludes anyone who commutes without a car from attending. Accessibility to this meeting will get even worse over the next 5 years due to two major highway projects on Loop 360 and Spicewood Springs Road. Holding all meetings at 2pm on weekdays without an option to dial-in. Effectively excluding anyone who works a daytime job for a living. Requiring all speakers to attend in person; no option to dial in to comment. Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Once plans are finalized the Texas Department of Transportation is the state’s department that creates roads for cars and trucks on ROWs that they own or have access to use. In principal a Department Of Transportation should create transportation options for all modes of transportation. However in practice and in law they spend almost all of their funding on road expansions.\nTxDOT road expansions include highways as well as many regular streets within cities and towns that they also own. This means that in some cases urbanist efforts to improve certain roads are frustrated by the state’s desire to harm its people over petty grievances. Due to this fatal crashes on state owned roadways continue to rise, while on non-state roads fatalities have remained flat.\nSource: Austin Vision Zero Update, May 25 2023\nTxDOT Funding Proposition 1: Directs 37.5% of existing oil and natural gas production taxes (aka severance) to TxDOT so that “the funds may only be used for constructing, maintaining, and acquiring rights-of-way for public roadways other than toll roads.”\nProposition 7: Directs portions of state sales and use taxes, as well as motor vehicle sale and rental taxes to: “(1) construct, maintain, or acquire rights of way for public roadways other than toll roads; or (2) repay the principal of and interest on general obligation bonds issued as authorized by Section 49-p, Article III, of this constitution.”\nIn combination these two propositions have lead to tens of billions of state tax dollars being directed towards maintaining and expanding highways and all the negatives that car dependent infrastructure brings to us and our cities.\nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program: This is a federal program which says when a state fails to meet their obligations under the Clean Air Act they can be awarded funding to improve their compliance. However this bill also allows up to 50% of funding to be redirected to other highway and transportation activities. The end result being that states are able to use funding intended for improving our air quality to instead construct additional highways and roads.\n“A State may transfer up to 50% of CMAQ funds made available each fiscal year to any other apportionment of the State, including the National Highway Performance Program, Surface Transportation Block Grant Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program, National Highway Freight Program [..]”\n","categories":"","description":"Highways are deadly, ugly, and environmentally disastrous.

If you want the full story of the egregious extent that all levels of US government and society went towards creating segregation then get yourself a copy. You can even check it out at the Austin Public Library. Housing segregation is neither natural nor unique to Austin. Rather it is something that has been intentionally created and enforced through local, state, and federal laws and agencies. It took every conceivable form and its remnants continue to exist today. Our country’s wounds are deep, have not ended, and they still have long to heal.\nThe forms it took are as numerous and creative as you can imagine. From local racial and euclidean zoning, neighborhood associations, and racial deed restrictions (aka. covenants). To state and country-wide highway expansion. To federal housing loans, public housing, and redlining. To the free market exploiting segregation in the form of blockbusting, contract sales, and 2008’s subprime mortgage crisis. Racist and exclusionary housing practices are not over either; recently Navy FCU was accused of systematically denying loan applications to qualified Black Americans who served in our armed forces.\nIntentional and legalized housing segregation continues to plague our cities and towns today.\nWhile many banks also approved White applicants at higher rates than Black borrowers, the nearly 29-percentage-point gap in Navy Federal’s approval rates was the widest of any of the 50 lenders that originated the most mortgage loans last year.\nThe disparity remains even among White and Black applicants who had similar incomes and debt-to-income ratios. Notably, Navy Federal approved a slightly higher percentage of applications from White borrowers making less than $62,000 a year than it did of Black borrowers making $140,000 or more.\n– Casey Tolan, Audrey Ash, \u0026 Rene Marsh via CNN\nA Note on The Impacts on People Below we describe the significant ways that our government and society created segregation both in Austin and throughout the US. But equally important is to keep in mind how the people who were victims of these policies were forced to live. They were living in poorly constructed housing that was intentionally placed far from work and “white” society. Despite this they’d often be paying much more for housing than other Americans due to limited options, and higher interest rates from private loans. As a result they’d often be forced to work multiple jobs, take on extra roommates, and have little time or energy to maintain their already poorly constructed housing. They’d have their roads less paved, their sewers less serviced, and other utilities and services neglected.\nMany racist stereotypes that exist today come from these conditions. Conditions that are forced on Black Americans and immigrant populations throughout our history. But as is often the case in America, Black Americans seem to get the worst of it; and we must do much better.\nDeed Restrictions / Racial Covenants If you live in a single family home on the west side of Austin it is very likely that your property has a deed restriction. It’s likely old, filed with the city, and was provided by your title company when you closed on your home. It may detail various things you can and cannot do with your propety from upkeep, to the colors you can paint your home, and the skin color or ethnicity of who is allowed to live in it.\nSuch restrictions as the one featured above were legal until 1948 when the Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kramer ruled them illegal. Except that the Federal Housing Authority which issued home loans kept issuing them to land owners who had racial covenants in their deed restrictions. This practice continued for over a year until Philip Perlman, the US Solicitor General, instituted a policy that prevented the FHA from giving out loans to such properties starting on February 15, 1950. This announcement was given with a grace period presumably so that racists could rush in any remaining racial covenants before the deadline and be grandfathered in.\nExcept it didn’t end here either. These covenants were then quickly replaced with prohibitively expensive “damages” that would be charged to land owners who violated a deed restriction and sold land or housing to non-whites. The Supreme Court banned this circumvention in the 1953 case Barrows v. Jackson.\nDespite the ultimate unenforceability of any racial covenants in deed restrictions post-1953 they were still able to be included in deed restrictions until a federal appeals court ruled in 1972 that they violated the Fair Housing Act. If they couldn’t be enforced such racist covenants could at least clearly communicate to would-be home buyers who was welcome and who was not.\nMapping segregation Many excellent people are working across the US to map racial covenants in their cities. No such attempt yet exists in Austin. Neighborhood Associations Neighborhood Associations came into fashion around the 1920s and went hand in hand with racial covenants in deed restrictions by allowing neighbors to enforce racial covenants. Prior to this a deed restriction was between the seller of a house, and the purchaser of a house. If these two parties decided to not be racist then a house could simply be sold or rented to whoever was wanting to buy or live in it as only these parties could enforce the racial covenant.\nThis practice was wide-spread and the difficulty of finding and reading through old deed restrictions has unfortunately left the data on it incomplete. Yet data and examples are still abundant. According to “The Color of Law” by Richard Rothstein (p. 80) a survey of 300 developments built between 1935-1947 in Queens, Nassau, and Westchester Counties found that 56% of all of them had racial covenants; as did 85% of large developments (75 or more units).\n[..] many subdivision developers created a community association before putting homes up for initial sale, and they made membership in it a condition of purchase. Association bylaws usually included a whites-only clause\n– “The Color of Law” by Richard Rothstein, p. 79\nPublic Housing In 1933 the US Government started responding to The Great Depression’s significant lack of affordable housing by constructing public housing as part of a series of progressive reforms known as The New Deal. Initially this was done at the federal level under the Public Works Administration (PWA) but shortly thereafter construction would be done at the state level with these projects being approved and funded by the federal United States Housing Authority (USHA).\nThese housing programs was simultaneously a progressive feat of socialized care for white Americans while also being a driver of segregation, inequity, and upheaval for non-white Americans. It accomplished this through policies of:\nBuilding racially segregated housing projects from the very beginning and in Austin of course; such as the Santa Rita Courts for Mexican Americans, Rosewood Courts for Black Americans, and Chalmers Court for white Americans. Wholesale demolition of integrated neighborhoods under the auspices of “slum clearance”. Enforcing neighborhood “composition” rules which turned integrated neighborhoods into segregated neighborhoods. Allowing for poor build quality in non-white neighborhoods (“The Color of Law”, p. 33). In fact the first USHA housing projects were constructed in Austin, TX. These projects involved creating separate white, Mexican, and Black housing projects. The white project would be placed closest to downtown, while the Mexican and Black neighborhoods would be placed on the then-outskirts of the city near heavy industry. Further cementing Austin’s 1928 master plan to segregate the previously integrated city.\nThroughout the US very little consideration was given to where non-white housing projects would be constructed so long as they were far away from white projects and neighborhoods. The first whites-only housing project starts construction in Austin. Neighborhoods were torn down under the auspices of 'slum clearance'. A thinly veiled code word for segregation.

Get involved with Rethink35 by volunteering, joining their Discord, and attending their events. They’ve also got all the standard social media that you can follow and share! What’s Happening? TxDOT is set to start construction on a massive I-35 expansion through central Austin in mid-2024. Local groups and elected officials have raised major concerns and opposition to the project, including:\nSept 26, 2023: Travis County Commissioners Court asks TxDOT to comply with air quality and environmental studies for I-35 project; which the county says they did not do. Oct 19, 2023: Austin City Council passed an official resolution asking TxDOT to pause the I-35 project until further environmental review is completed. Nov 5, 2023: Over 300 activists attended the “Wider Won’t Work” rally to oppose I-35 expansion; including U.S. Congressman Greg Casar. TxDOT solicited comments on their draft Environmental Impact Statement. 75% of public comments opposed the expansion. TxDOT has yet to listen to the public, to elected officials, and to common sense that shows highways have been a fatal and failed experiment in moving people safely and efficiently around the US.\nRail is faster If a train ran along I-35 it could get you from San Antonio to Austin in 38 minutes, or from San Antonio to Dallas in 2 hours and 8 minutes. Rethink35 Lawsuit Rethink35 and 16 other plaintiffs have sued TxDOT. The lawsuit alleges:\nTxDOT didn’t properly study other options such as: The Rethink 35 proposal which involved rerouting the highway and replacing it with a boulevard. The Reconnect Austin vision which called for the highway being placed underground with a boulevard on top. TxDOT failed to study several air pollutants and their impacts on the people who live near I-35. This includes particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) which puts people at increased risk for asthma and other health conditions. Based on new EPA standards, Austin is already above the safe limit. TxDOT was aware of this concern. There was a significant change to the water outfall that was made after the Draft Environmental Impact Statement was published and so there was no opportunity for public comment. Polluted runoff from the highway will exit into a wildlife preserve in East Austin; around US-183 and the Colorado River. Civil Rights (Title VI) Complaint Rethink35 has also filed a Title VI civil rights complaint. The complaint alleges:\nI-35 was built to be intentionally discriminatory by replacing East Ave and solidifying a line of segregation between East and West Austin. Under Title VI, agencies with a history of prior discrimination have a responsibility to take affirmative action to redress previous injustices. Instead, this project exacerbates these very same harmful practices by: Displacing people from homes and businesses. 86% of the displaced are in Environmental Justice communities (ie. low income, and people of color). More than doubling the number of lane miles of I-35. Thus widening the barrier between East and West Austin. Dumping polluted storm water into a Wildlife Sanctuary in East Austin, continuing a long-standing pattern of moving environmental waste from downtown to East Austin. Worsening air quality, climate change, and increasing summer temperatures, all of which disproportionately burden communities of color.

On November 2nd, 2023 Austin made the historic step of removing parking mandates and is now the largest city in the country to do so. This was only possible thanks to many advocates getting involved! Parking mandates (aka parking minimums) were first created in the 1950s as a measure to provide parking for America’s then fledgling car culture. However, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), these mandates are based on limited and highly inaccurate data published in a report called “Parking Generation” by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). Data in this report is allowed to be based on sample sizes of just 4. This means that a “study” could observe 4 total car trips and be included as bona fide evidence of exactly how much parking an entire city needs. If you have an understanding of statistics you should read the rest of the BTS’s analysis on this subject because the methodology is much worse than this tiny sample size.\nITE presents 14 studies of trip generation at recreational land uses but says “No Plot or Equation AvailableInsufficient Data.” The trip generation rates in the 14 studies range from a high of 296 to a low of 0.066 trips per acre on a weekday: a ratio of 4,500 to 1. Given this wide range, reporting the average trip generation rate as precisely 3.635 trips per acre is clearly misleading.\n“Truth in Transportation Planning” by Donald C. Shoup (Bureau of Transportation Statistics)\nInstitute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation, 4th edition (Washington, DC: 1987), p. 1,199. (via BTS)\nThe end result being that there are now an estimated 700 million to 2 billion parking spaces / (archive.ph mirror) per person in the US. We’ve built so much parking that nobody knows the true number. Put another way, at minimum, the US has between 2.1 and 6 parking spaces for every child under driving age.\nParking in Austin 17% of Downtown Austin is parking today. However the very good news is that parking mandates in Austin have recently been removed allowing for greater flexibility in how many parking spaces need to exist and allowing cities to reclaim parking spaces for human-centered, rather than car-centered uses. This, like many positive reforms, is due to the researchers, advocates, elected officials, city staff, and all those who worked to shed light on the parking issue our cities face.\nWhile 17% of a city’s downtown core is certainly a huge amount, Austin performs better than Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio where, according to Axios, 25% of their downtowns are dedicated to storing cars. The national average is 20%!\nAlso worth keeping in mind that these rules do not eliminate parking, notably:\nResidential and Commercial buildings can still build the parking they believe they need Federal standards around parking accessibility for people with disabilities will still be kept We have a heck of a lot of parking already Austin’s Strategic Mobility Plan intends to have net no additional driving by 2039 by encouraging other forms of transportation for short distances 🚲 50% of trips in the US are 3 miles or less. As long as the infrastructure is there this is a quick 10 to 15 minute ride on an e-Bike or manual bike. Learn more about the benefits of biking, the city’s plans, and e-Bike discounts in our article on biking. Impacts of Parking Mandates Large added expense to housing costs: According to Austin’s Housing \u0026 Planning department each parking spot in Austin adds $200/month to rent and $20,000-$60,000 per space in parking structures. These significant yet hidden costs add to displacement pressure in our cities, contributing to the further pricing out of people. Creation of heat islands: As anyone who’s had the displeasure of walking across a shopping mall during Texas’ high heat can tell you, asphalt holds a lot of heat and can reach surface temperatures as high as 180 degrees. They then release this heat at night, creating summers that are perpetually hot no matter the hour. It only takes just a fraction of a second to suffer a pretty serious burn. Asphalt and concrete in direct sunlight can often reach surface temperatures as high as 82 Celsius (180 Fahrenheit) on the hottest days, said Dr. Kevin Foster, who directs the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix.\n– Dr. Kevin Foster, US News, “How Concrete, Asphalt and Urban Heat Islands Add to the Misery of Heat Waves”\n","categories":"","description":"Parking has long dominated our cities, creating heat islands and straining housing.

These laws largely make it illegal to build anything other than single family homes in most areas of most of the US and intentionally relegate more affordable styles of housing to far away areas and beside noisy highways with poor air quality and little options to go outside.\nUrbanists seek to reform these laws so that more varied types of housing can be built in more locations. While results will vary depending on the type of reform, in general these types of reforms can result in more affordable housing, walkable and friendly neighborhoods, and more diversity of income within a single neighborhood.\nBig picture these reforms seek to make a neighborhood more like a neighborhood and less like a series of large expensive pods where neighbors can’t easily interact.\nTo put it another way, these reforms seek to be big tent where if someone wants to live in a single family house they certainly can but they do not get to say that their neighborhood should exclude young adults, service workers, or first responders on the basis of income.\nToday many cottages, townhouses, apartment buildings, condos, and other housing get relegated to specially designated areas. Any amenities they have, such as a park, or local walkable grocery, are cut off by distance and roads from the rest of the town or city.\nHousing reform is all about sharing a vibrant neighborhood with your neighbors rather than cutting out your own tiny and uninteresting sliver.\nGood Transportation Urbanism takes the realistic stance that a car dependent society has been a significant failure in many aspects of life, from smog and health, to loneliness and isolation, to thousands of hours wasted in traffic, to 40,000 yearly traffic fatalities and 2,500,000 injuries. Someone you know, care about, or love will be seriously injured or killed on a road at some point in your life. It is a statistical inevitability. Many times when this happens we will blame the driver, or call it an “accident” but the true cause of this unnecessary suffering is undoubtedly car dependence.\nWhile cars are still necessary urbanism seeks to reform our car dependent society and shift to multi-modal transportation which reduces our need for cars. This includes making space and improvements for bus lanes, bike lanes, trains, walking, and hoverboards once science catches up. Many of our towns and cities today are hostile to non-car transportation. Lacking shade, sidewalks, and safe street crossings they are wholly unfit for most people most of the time.\nUrbanism also seeks to make things safer and faster for cars, manual laborers, and emergency vehicles. By getting drivers off the road when they don’t need to be our roads become less occupied with cars and reduce traffic. With less cars on the road maintenance is also reduced and the occurrence of potholes and need to repave roads becomes less frequent.\nMuch like housing, the urbanist approach to road safety is also big tent. Some people will need to use roads for their job or for particularly remote travel or just because they like driving on open roads every so often. That’s perfectly fine but we must make our roads less crowded and safer.\nHuman Scale Neighborhoods Most US neighborhoods are built at car scale rather than human scale. They prioritize placing housing separate from spaces such as parks, groceries, restaurants, and all other types of places where people like to gather. They create long travel distances for the types of things that replenish everything from your fridge to your soul.\nHuman scale neighborhoods seek to bring these necessities of life closer to where people live. Allowing people to easily bump into their neighbors. To get that missing ingredient they need for tonight’s dinner. Or hop on a bus to and from a restaurant without worrying about parking, expensive taxis. Closer amenities make our roads less busy, reduce our climate impact, and drop drunk driving rates.\nFairness Our cities unfortunately have a history of unfair treatment depending on who you are and where you live. These issues are many and vast, some of the most salient of which are:\nRedlining: The wholesale exclusion of racial and ethnic minority neighborhoods from financial services such as home loans. Segregation by design: How local governments through policy and actions forced our cities and neighborhoods to be segregated. Such as the destruction of Black American and immigrant neighborhoods to build highways as physical barriers separating former neighbors. Zoning: The habit of wealthy neighbors to advocate for moving whatever they don’t want to less fortunate neighborhoods.

Here we’ll first cover the history and origins of zoning, then we’ll discuss current zoning laws, and finally what is and can be done to fix zoning.\nA “Brief” History of Zoning To put it bluntly, zoning is a direct extension of government mandated and enforced racial segregation. While massive strides have been made with ending Jim Crow laws and forced racial segregation of schools, transportation, and public facilities there still exists the lesser known issue of government enforced segregation of our cities.\nThe first zoning laws in the US were based on race and this racial zoning was legal within the US until 1917 when it was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Buchanan v. Warley. This case was initially prompted by William Warley, a NAACP lawyer, who attempted to buy land in Louisville, Kentucky and occupy a home on it. Louisville had a zoning law that explicitly forbid Black Americans from occupying homes in Louisville. Due to this law William Warley argued he should not have to fulfill his agreement to buy the land because he could not live on it.\nBlacks should be quarantined in isolated slums in order to reduce the incidence of civil disturbance, to prevent the spread of communicable disease into nearby white neighborhoods, and to protect property values among the White majority\n– J. Barry Mahool (via thebaltimorestory.org)\nUltimately the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that excluding Black Americans from White neighborhoods infringed upon White land-owner’s right to sell their property to whomever they wished. Thus any race based zoning was now illegal and unenforceable throughout the US. The court paid no concern to Black American’s right to live where they wanted.\nEuclidean Zoning In the months prior to the 1917 Supreme Court decision the racist and wealthy within US cities got to work devising ways to side step this ruling. To keep up the violation of American citizen’s civil and constitutional rights.\nA New York City based organization called the Fifth Avenue Association created a campaign that would take racial zoning and make it much more insidious. Rather than excluding based on race or ethnicity the new laws could exclude based on attributes more common to Black, Brown, and White immigrant Americans.\nThe first such campaign for this new kind of zoning was termed “Save New York” and it targeted garment factories on 5th Avenue. However the factories themselves were not really an issue to the Fifth Avenue Association and White New Yorkers. Instead the issue was that garment workers were primarily Jewish and Italian immigrants. If they could legislate away the garment industry they could legislate away these ethnic groups.\nThe campaign’s goals unfortunately succeeded all too well and the first modern Euclidean zoning law was enacted in New York on July 25, 1916.\nAt the opening of the 20th century, tens of thousands of garment workers began to clog the streets of Fifth Avenue, strolling and window-shopping, and meeting informally to discuss the vagaries of the trade. For property and business owners along Fifth Avenue, however, the workers constituted nothing short of an immigrant horde that had to be stopped.\nSource: “A Stitch in Time: A History of New York’s Garment District” by Gabriel Montero\nThis new style of zoning quickly spread throughout the US. In fact the first Supreme Court case concerning Euclidean zoning, Euclid v. Amber, was heard in 1926. The case concerned the Village of Euclid’s new zoning law designed to keep “industrial Cleveland” from changing the “character of the village”. While a lower court determined that Euclid’s zoning law was unconstitutional the Supreme Court ultimately sided with the village and upheld the exclusionary zoning. Now with a Supreme Court decision similar use-based zoning towards discriminatory ends was further emboldened.\nThe character of the neighborhood Be wary of calls to “Save” neighborhoods and cities. To preserve property values. To protect “neighborhood character”. A City Plan for Austin Just a few years later Austin penned its first planning document in 1928, “A City Plan for Austin, Texas” that included bountiful amenities for its White residents, and segregation for its Black residents who would be pushed to the East side and then forgotten about. According to “The Color of Law” by Richard Rothstein their roads were left less paved, their sewers unmaintained and clogged, and their bus routes suspended in the summer.\nOver time more approaches to zoning were devised such as surreptitious increases to minimum lot sizes from none up until 1929 to 3,000 square feet in 1930, then 3,500 in 1941, and a whopping 5,750 square feet in 1946. Lot sizes were then paired with the creation of single family zoning, setbacks, and so on. Each of these policies serving to further exclude Black and Brown Americans from home ownership by making it prohibitively expensive for them to own property within White neighborhoods.\nStreets would be widened and paved to account for increasing automobile use (Austinites were already complaining about traffic in 1928). Boulevards would be sculpted and lined with trees. Playgrounds and parks would be built within a half-mile walk of every person in the city […]\nAnd black Austinites would be shunted into a new “[black] district.”\nSource: “The Problem We Still Live With” by Ryan Puzycki\nAnd thus we find ourselves with the result: two Austins. One of which has benefited immensely from repeatedly pushing people out and the other which has repeatedly suffered from being pushed.\nWhen anti-housing advocates ask to preserve single family zoning, to put all new housing on the East side, and to build further and further away they ask to continue the same segregationist policies that the city has practiced for nearly 100 years.\nAustin’s Present Day Zoning This section/topic is incomplete.
